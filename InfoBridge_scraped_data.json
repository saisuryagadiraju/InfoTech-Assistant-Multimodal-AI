AE technology can also be applied to monitor a retrofit that is intended to arrest cracks or stop new fatigue cracks from developing. AE technology can be applied to detect and monitor cracks in the following elements:\nSteel girders.\nTruss members.\nPin and hanger assemblies.\nEyebars.\nFigure 1 shows AE sensors mounted on a steel girder to detect the development of cracks in the weld between the web and diaphragm.\nFigure 1. Photo. AE Sensors Mounted on a Steel Girder.\nAE signals released from cracks developing in the weld and are detected by the sensors. Sensors are connected to a data acquisition system that detects AE events and identifies events resulting from crack initiation. \nDescription\nAE technology uses NDE techniques for detecting, locating, and monitoring fatigue cracks in steel bridges. AE can be used on a wide variety of metal structures, including airframes, pipelines, and pressure vessels. AE is implemented by mounting one or more acoustic sensors on the surface of the material being tested to detect transient elastic waves produced by the evolution of damage in the material; for example, when a crack increases in length due to the application of load, acoustic waves are produced. These waves spread through the material and are detected by the acoustic sensors mounted on the surface. The waveform signals detected by the acoustic sensor(s) are analyzed to determine the rate at which AE signals produced from damage evolution are occurring. This analysis helps locate the damage and estimate the rate at which the damage is progressing.\nAE signals are produced by the progression of damage such as the increase in length of a fatigue crack; therefore, loading must be applied to cause the damage to progress. For crack detection in highway bridges, a structure is monitored over time as traffic loads are applied to the bridge, which may result in crack growth. If a fatigue crack is not increasing in length, AE signals generally are not produced. Consequently, AE is not an effective method for detecting arrested cracks or other damage not progressing under load application. \nThe position of the AE source can be found by triangulating based on the arrival time of the acoustic waves and the wave velocity in the material. Additional sensors may be employed as \u201cguard\u201d sensors to detect AE signals generated from sources outside an area of interest.\nAE technology is commonly used to monitor crack growth in steel bridges or determine if a retrofit intended to arrest cracking has been successful. AE can also be used to detect a crack that is progressing; for example, AE may be used to monitor a structural detail that is susceptible to crack growth to detect the development of a new crack.\nPhysical Principle \nAE is an NDE technique that is used to detect damage in materials by analyzing acoustic signals produced from cracks and other defects. AE is defined as the rapid release of energy in the form of a transient elastic stress wave generated by an acoustic source. Crack growth, crack fretting, and corrosion act as acoustic sources during damage evolution, producing transient elastic waves (i.e., acoustic waves). The acoustic waves can be detected by placing sensors on the surface of the material. Figure 2 illustrates the principles of AE schematically. A stimulus, such as an applied load, results in increasing damage in the material such as the extension of a crack. When the crack extension occurs, one or more bursts of waves are released and propagate through the material. A sensor placed on the surface of the material detects the acoustic wave and records the waveform signal for analysis. The waveform signals are analyzed to detect the progression of damage in the material.(1,2,3)\nFigure 2. Illustration. AE Sensors Mounted on a Compact Tension Specimen and Connected to an AE Data Acquisition System with the Typical AE Waveform Parameters.\nData Acquisition\nEquipment for conducting AE monitoring consists of acoustic sensors, data acquisition electronics, and a computer to analyze the data. Signals received from each sensor are digitized and analyzed with a computer system using specialized software.\nAcoustic sensors are ultrasonic sensors in the 50 kHz to 1 MHz frequency range with integrated preamplifiers. The integrated preamplifiers are required to detect the AE waveforms produced from damage in the material because the acoustic signals are very low in amplitude.\nFigure 3. Composite Graph. AE Monitoring Scheme.\nData Processing \nRecorded waveforms are analyzed to determine if the source of the waveform is damage or simply ambient noise caused by non-relevant noise sources, such as friction between surfaces, the movement of bolted connection or bearings, etc. Parameters of the waveform are determined as a means of discriminating noise from relevant AE signals. For example, figure 3 shows a typical AE waveform. Parameters that describe this waveform include the amplitude of the wave, the rise time, the total energy in the wave packet, and the number and duration of \u201ccounts\u201d or wave cycles recorded that exceeded a certain threshold. Other parameters, such as the frequency characteristics of the waveform and geometric shape of the wave packets, may also be used. These parameters are then used to discriminate between acoustic waves corresponding to damage evolution and ambient noise. Waveforms that correspond to damage evolution are called \u201cAE events.\u201d(2)\nData Interpretation \nThe rate of occurrence of AE events is interpreted to identify AE sources in the material, i.e. damage.  The location of the source of the AE signal is also used in the interpretation of results. For example, a high number of AE events emanating from a particular location in a structure during the application of loads may be interpreted to indicate damage at that location. The rate of AE events generally increases when damage increases. The increase in AE activity is interpreted as an indication that the damage is increasing. For example, as a crack grows as a result of applied loads, the number of AE events increases. The rate of increase in length can be estimated from the rate of increase in AE activity.\nAdvantages \nCan be used to monitor large areas of a structure.\nCan detect crack growth and estimate crack growth rates.\nCan be used to monitor complex geometries where other NDE technology may be ineffective.\nCan be used to monitor for damage located in inaccessible areas.\nLimitations  \nComplex data interpretation. Acoustic signals can result from many sources in addition to a crack or defect. \nCan only detect increasing damage (for example, a crack that is growing).\nReferences \nAmerican Society of Nondestructive Testing (ASNT) Handbook, 3rd Edition, Vol.6, pp. 32, 2005.\nGostautas, R., Steel Bridge Testing Program (Interim report) \u201cEvaluation of an Acoustic Emission Inspection System\u201d  submitted by Physical Acoustics Corporation to FHWA NDE, December, 2008.\nHuang, M., Jiang, L., Liaw, K.P., Brooks, R.C., Seeley, R. and Klarstrom, L.D., \u201cUsing Acoustic Emission in Fatigue and Fracture Materials Research,\u201d The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society, 1998.\nLast updated on August 18, 2022",

Compared to the other nondestructive evaluation (NDE) techniques, acoustic tomography provides a more detailed assessment of the internal condition of wood members by providing two-dimensional (2D) images of a member\u2019s cross section.(1)\nPhysical Principle\nTomographic inversion involves creating 2D images of a member cross section (representing the distribution of velocity) by using the stress wave data from multiple transmitters and receivers attached to the sides of the member. The technique uses acoustic impulse as the energy source, and it commonly estimates the time of flight (TOF) to assess the wave velocity along multipaths between transmitters and receivers. TOF is the time it takes for an acoustic wave to travel between transmitter and receiver. Because the wave velocity is directly related to the density and elastic properties of wood, the areas with lower velocities can indicate the deteriorated regions of wood members.(1)\nThe frequency of stress waves, distance between sensors, and type of algorithm used to construct the tomographic images can affect the accuracy of acoustic tomography in identifying deteriorated regions.(1)\nFor the TOF measurements, acoustic tomography commonly uses 8\u201312 sensors to obtain images with sufficient resolution (figure 1). For higher resolution images, 24\u201336 sensors may be required. The sensors are typically connected to members using pins or nails, and a steel hammer strikes them sequentially to generate acoustic waves. In ultrasonic tomography, piezoelectric transducers attached to wood members using gel-type couplant are used to generate and receive stress waves. For field applications, a flexible mounting frame can facilitate the sensor installment and testing.(2)\nSource: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service\nA.

Sensor attachment.\nFigure 1. Photo and schematic. Acoustic tomography test of a timber post: (a) sensor arrangement and paths of acoustic waves in a round timber,(1) (b) sensor attachment.(2)\nData Acquisition\nThe acoustic tomography equipment generally involves a series of low-noise piezoelectric sensors, cables, tape, or caliper to measure the member dimension and distance between sensor locations, pins for attaching sensors, an amplifier, steel hammer, rechargeable batteries, and processing software. Depending on the number of sensors used during the test and the accessibility of the test location, scanning of a member cross section can take between 20\u201330 min.(1)\nThe test procedure is as follows:\nIdentify the test location, and measure its circumference using a tape measure.\nDetermine the number of sensors to be used.\nMark the starting point (sensor number one) at a test location, and use a tape measure to mark the position of sensors around the cross section.\nDrive the attachment pins into the wood member using a hammer, and attach the piezoelectric sensors to the pins. Insert spiked sensors directly into a wood member.\nMeasure the distances between the sensors, and enter the measured data into the software.\nStart the test by tapping sensors sequentially with a steel hammer starting from sensor number one to generate stress waves.\nThe software produces a 2D color tomogram showing the geometry of the cross section and the distribution of TOF values (figure 2).\nSource: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service.\nFigure 2. Photo and contour map. Cross section and acoustic tomography of a timber member at the Imperial Palace in Beijing, China(1)\nData Processing\nThe TOF data are analyzed in the acoustic tomography software to create a 2D tomogram.\nData Interpretation\nThe 2D tomogram represents the distribution of velocities in the cross-section of wood members. The results are qualitative.\nAdvantages\nCompared to other NDE techniques, a 2D tomogram provides a more detailed assessment of wood members.\n2D tomogram is useful in scanning members with large cross sections.\nLimitations\nThe current acoustic tomography techniques are primarily based on TOF measurements, which limit the accuracy and resolution of the tomographic images obtained. They are typically sensitive to moderate- to severe state of decay rather than early-stage decay.\nThe construction of tomograms from the TOF data is affected by the pronounced anisotropic nature of wood materials.\nThe results are qualitative, and additional testing is recommended, such as resistance microdrilling, to obtain quantitative local information. Additional testing can confirm the condition of a wood member.\nRefrences\nWhite, R. H., and R. J. Ross (2014). Wood and timber condition assessment manual. General Technical Report FPL-GTR-234.

Main applications of active IRT include detecting the following: \nShallow delamination in concrete members.(1) \nCorrosion of steel members under paints.\nDelamination in fiber-reinforced polymers.(4) \nShallow utilities, honeycombing, and voids in concrete members. \nDescription\nUnlike passive IRT, which uses solar radiation or heat from the surrounding area, active IRT uses an external heat source to induce thermal changes in the material being tested. The heat source can be a propane heater, high-power lamp, infrared (IR) heating element, or flash lamp.(1-5) An IR camera measures IR radiation and converts such measurements into electrical signals. The detection of defects is based on measuring temperature variations on the surface of an element; these variations are caused by different thermal conductivity, specific heat capacity, and thermal conduction because of discontinuities in the element. Thermal images may be captured before the heating period, during the heating period, and during the cooling period. Figure 1 shows the test setup for detecting concrete delaminations in a specimen with active IRT. Areas with shallow delaminations heat up more quickly and develop surface temperatures up to several degrees higher than the surrounding areas of sound steel.(6) \nSource: FHWA. \nFigure 1. Photo. Concrete delamination detection using active IRT. \nActive IRT can be categorized by its applied heating function. Impulse thermography applies a short energy pulse to the measured object with high-energy flash systems. Transient thermography is similar to impulse thermography, but the energy is applied over a period of time. Transient thermography allows the use of low-cost excitation sources, such as halogen lamps or hot-air blowers. Lock-in thermography applies periodic harmonicmodulated energy to the element. The depth range can be set through the modulation frequency of the excitation source to obtain the best possible result. Compared to the transient method, measuring times needed for lock-in thermography are considerably longer. \nPhysical Principle \nIRT is based on measuring thermal radiation emitted by structural elements (figure 2). Thermal radiation, which is in the wavelength range of 0.7\u201314 \u03bcm (0.028\u20130.55 mils) of the electromagnetic spectrum, is controlled by three main properties that influence the heat flow and distribution within a material: thermal conductivity, specific heat capacity, and mass density. Exposing the surface of a material to a radiant heat source, such as an IR heater, will cause an increase in surface temperature and diffusion of heat into the material to achieve thermal equilibrium. Subsurface defects, such as delamination or steel corrosion, interrupt the flow of heat. As a result, the surface temperature will be higher in the area of the defect relative to the surface temperature adjacent to the flaw. Therefore, it will cause higher radiation. \n\u00a9 2016 G. Washer. \nFigure 2. Illustration. Physical principle of active IRT. \nData Acquisition \nActive IRT uses radiant and fan heaters or flash and halogen lamps, thus eliminating dependence on heat from the sun or other natural heating sources. While active IRT may produce better controlled and higher quality results than passive IRT, it is used only in evaluations of smaller elements. IR cameras used for active IRT typically have the ability to capture thermal images at fixed time intervals during the course of testing. Many images are captured during heating and/or cooling of the material and stored for analysis. ASTM\u202fD4788-03, Standard Test Method for Detecting Delaminations in Bridge Decks Using Infrared Thermography, can be used for surface preparation and other steps of data acquisition.(7) \nData Processing \nAn IR thermal camera records a series of IR images or a video. Thermal images in combination with digital camera images facilitate locating potential defects and anomalies on the surface of an element. Data processing involves analyzing thermal images to identify anomalies in the material being tested. Data may be processed in several ways. Temperature anomalies may be observed in the thermal images produced following the heating of the surface. The time series data for individual pixels in the thermal image may be analyzed as shown in figure 3.(8) The amplitude and delay of the peak of this signal are a function of the depth, thickness, and spatial extent of the defect and may be further analyzed to better characterize the defect. \n\u00a9 2016 G.

Surface temperature variations and thermal contrasts as\u202fa\u202ffunction\u202fof\u202ftime.  \nMore advanced methods of processing data from active IRT tests include analyzing the slope of the heating and cooling cycle and time characteristics (i.e., phase) and frequency characteristics of the temperature decay.(9) In most cases, results of the IRT inspection are displayed as an image of part of the surface to identify flaws against the background of sound material. \nData Interpretation \nSimilar to passive IRT, surface temperature from active IRT tests can be presented in colorcoded contour maps (figure 4). Areas with damages or defects manifest as different colors than sound areas. IR images from active IRT tests can be compared to or superimposed on regular photos to enhance the interpretation of conditions by correlating the visible damage, such as spalling on the surface, to thermal anomalies. \nSource: FHWA. \nT\u00b0F = (T\u00b0C \u00d7 1.8) + 32. \nFigure 4.

        "text": "NDE\nBridge\nAutomated Sounding\nTechnology\nAutomated Sounding\nExport PDF\nTarget of investigation\nAutomated sounding is mainly used to detect delamination in plate-like concrete structures, such as bridge decks. Depending on vendors, the system can also reveal the plate thickness of intact areas and characterize the size and depth of delaminated areas using advanced data processing algorithms.(1) This web page only covers using automated sounding systems for detecting delamination in concrete bridge decks.\nDescription\nAutomated sounding is similar to traditional chain-drag or hammer sounding but runs in an automated way. An automated sounding system consists of dragging chains, hammers, or steel rods as impactors and air-coupled acoustic sensors, such as microelectromechanical system microphones, for data acquisition. The system can be cart based, as shown in figure 1. The system can also be towed by a vehicle, enabling rapid, nondestructive evaluation of concrete bridge decks at approximately 20 mph (30 km/h) in lieu of complete lane closures.(2)\nFigure 1. Photo. A bridge inspector uses a cart-based sounding (impact echo) system on a bridge deck in Iowa.(2)\nPhysical Principle\nPerforming chain dragging or hammer sounding on a moderate to severely delaminated area in concrete plate-like structures, where the lateral extension of the discontinuity is much larger than its depth, excites flexural oscillation from about 1 kHz\u20133 kHz. This oscillation is within the auditable frequency range (about 20 Hz\u201320 kHz) of humans and sounds \u201chollowly.\u201d\nData Acquisition\nFor a complete test procedure for sounding, refer to ASTM Standard D4580/D4580M-12, Standard Practice for Measuring Delaminations in Concrete Bridge Decks by Sounding.(3)\nBefore conducting the test, any accumulation of debris on the deck must be removed. The automated sounding system rolls over the bridge deck, scanning the entire surface by chain dragging or tapping with the steel rod or hammer. For hammer sounding, a time interval should be selected based on testing purposes. A shorter time interval represents a closer scanning space. Closer scanning spacings are typically used for indepth analyses, and wider spacings are generally used for condition surveys of the bridge deck.\nData Processing\nData processing includes performing a spectrum analysis using the fast Fourier Transform to transform time-series sonic signals into amplitude spectrums in the frequency domain.(4) Peaks in the amplitude spectrum represent dominant frequency components in the collected data. Because data are collected continuously at the speed of the mounting vehicle, the short-time Fourier Transform can be used to generate a spectrogram that has both frequency and time information. With a known moving speed of the vehicle, the time axis can be mapped to the longitudinal length of the scanning area.\nNoises may exist in the collected data. A field test report from the Nebraska DOT showed that traffic noises did not affect the test because their frequency amplitudes are only 10 percent of that represented in a delaminated area.(4) Still, careful examinations are needed to identify and filter out noises from the measuring system. The same report showed that a noticeable level of noise around 15 kHz was caused by clapping between chain links.\nData Interpretation\nWhen a concrete plate is in its intact condition, the thickness mode of the plate dominates the collected signal, and a clear ringing sound will be heard. The frequency of the thickness mode corresponds to the zero-group-velocity frequency of the S1 Lamb mode, which depends on the plate thickness, concrete material, and Poisson\u2019s ratio.(5) In shallow delaminated areas, flexural oscillation with a frequency lower than the thickness mode dominates the sonic signal, and a dull or hollow sound is emitted. This acoustic characteristic can help identify delaminated areas. Results are often described in contour maps that mark out delaminated areas, as shown in figure 2. More laboratory and field-testing results may be found in these reports.(6,7)\n\u00a9 2022 Bridge Diagnostics, Inc. (BDI).\nFigure 2. Graphic. Sample contour map that marks out delaminated areas.\nAdvantages\nAgrees with the manual-sounding results but runs much faster.\nEliminates a complete lane closure of the system if towed by a vehicle.\nIdentifies severe to moderate delamination that reasonably agrees with manual sounding.\nEnables data storage for further investigation.\nLimitations\nModerate to significant expertise and training is required for equipment setup and data collection, processing, and interpretation.\nCareful noise analysis and filtering is typically required.\nSpecial analysis is needed for delamination detection on decks with asphalt overlays.\nReferences\nHajin, C., S.

        "text": "NDE\nBridge\nCoring\nTechnology\nCoring\nExport PDF\nTarget of investigations\nCoring with an increment borer is considered the most dependable technique for investigating internal decay and estimating the age of a tree.(1,2) This approach results in small diameter (i.e., 0.169 inch) but relatively long (i.e., 10 inch) cores.\nThe cylindrical core sample is another type of core not discussed in this document which has a larger diameter but shorter length (approximately 2 inches). Cores are typically used to determine moisture content, specific gravity, and type of species and grade when performing a bridge load rating analysis. Cores are extracted using a portable drill and a specialized drill bit. Treated wood plugs are then glued into the holes after the core is removed.\nDescription\nThrough examining a solid sample from a questionable member, coring enables identification of the presence of voids, the depth of preservative penetration and retention, and the type of wood species.\nPhysical Principle\nCoring involves the visual inspection of a solid sample from a suspect member to investigate the presence of defects, depth of decay, depth of preservative penetration, or type of wood species\nData Acquisition\nThe incremental borer is a precision instrument consisting of three parts: handle, auger, and extractor (figure 1). An operator uses the handle to apply torque to the auger, which is threaded at its tip for cutting into the wood. After cutting, the core sample is handled by the extractor. The borers are available in various lengths between 4 inches (100 mm) and 28 inches (700 mm), in 2\u2011inch (50 mm) increments.(3) The borers are also available in two-thread and three-thread designs. A two-thread design cuts at a slower speed and, thus, it is more appropriate for cutting into hardwood. On the other hand, a three-thread design cuts at a faster rate and is more appropriate for softwood. The common internal diameters of the borer (which determines the width of the core) are 0.169 inch (4.35 mm) and 0.2 inch (5.15 mm), although 0.32 inch (8 mm), 0.4 inch (10 mm), and 0.48 inch (12 mm) sizes are also available. The larger diameter borers require more physical effort to cut into the wood.(3)\nFor coring, place the incremental borer at the core location, and hold the shaft of the auger with one hand while putting the other hand at the center of the handle.(3) Apply enough pressure for the auger tip to penetrate the wood member and rotate the handle. Continue rotating the handle until the auger threads are fully engaged. The hammer should not be used to force the borer to enter the wood.(3)\nBoring can be accomplished using both hands and at half-turn (better for hardwood) or full-turn (better for softwood) rotations. At the start of boring, keep the handle as steady as possible without wobbling to the sides to obtain a straight core.(3)\nWhen the desired core length is achieved, insert the extractor with a flash and move all the way into the auger. Turn the handle counterclockwise for one or two full turns to separate the core from the rest of the wood, and then pull the extractor. The core can be stored in a tube, such as a paper or plastic straw, where one end is closed, and straws should be labeled with a pen or marker.\nAfter coring, the borer may be removed from the wood by turning the handle counterclockwise. If the auger is not engaged with the wood, the handle should be pulled and turned to remove the incremental borer.\nBoring tools should be cleaned after extracting each core to avoid transferring microorganisms.(1) The bored-out holes should be filled with wood plugs treated with preservatives such as copper naphthalene.(2) When stored, the borer components should be lubricated to prevent the corrosion of components.(3)\nSource: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service\nFigure 1.

Cracks detected using other methods, such as visual inspection, can be monitored with the gages to evaluate if the crack is growing. Fatigue cracks in a steel girder can be monitored with CPGs to monitor the rate at which the crack is growing as a result of the applied loading. \nCPGs can also be used to monitor localized areas of a structure where cracking is likely to develop. In this way, the gage can be used as a crack detection tool that monitors the area continuously to determine if a crack develops.\nDescription\nA CPG consists of a series of conductive tracks etched on a polymer substrate.  The gage is bonded to the surface of a specimen in the area of the crack tip such that growth of the crack will result in individual tracks in the gage being fractured, affecting the resistance of the gage. \nFigure 1 shows a schematic diagram of two CPGs mounted on the surface of an eyebar. The gages are mounted on the eyebar head in the area where cracks initiating at the bore of the eyebar would be expected to grow through the eyebar head. In this way, the gage acts as a crack detection sensor that produces a resistance change if a crack develops in the area under the gage.\nFigure 1. Illustration. Two CPGs Mounted on an Eyebar Head to Detect Cracks Initiating at the Bore of the Eyebar.\nCPGs are available is a variety of different sizes and shapes. For example, gages with circular or semi-circular shapes are produced for monitoring cracks initiating at bolt holes. Rectangular-shaped gages (figure 2) are available in a variety of different sizes and are typically used for monitoring cracks in plates. Gages are bonded to the surface using an adhesive. Surface preparation is required to ensure sufficient bonding between the gage and the surface such that crack growth will result fracture of the conductive tracks. \nFigure2. Photo. A Crack Propagation Gage Bonded to the Surface of a Specimen to Monitor the Growth of a Crack.\nPhysical Principle \nCPGs are used to measure the growth of a surface-breaking crack. The sensor consists of a pattern of conductive tracks etched on a non-conductive polymer substrate. The gage is bonded to the specimen surface at the tip of a crack (figure 3). When the crack length increases, the individual tracks in the sensor gage are fractured, causing the resistance of the gage to increase. A simple voltage or resistance measurement across the terminals on the gage indicates the number of tracks that are fractured, and these changes are interpreted to determine the crack growth.(1)\nFigure 3. Illustration. Crack Propagation Gage Placement.\nData Acquisition\nThe data produced by a CPG is a voltage or resistance measurement based on the resistance of the gage. The resistance of the gage increases when individual conductive tracks are fractured by a crack propagating across the gage. Instrumentation to read a CPG can be as simple as an ohmmeter with milliohm sensitivity to measure the resistance of the gage directly. Common data acquisition systems can also be used to monitor the voltage output of the gage. Data is typically collected during a long time intervals, such as weeks or even years, depending on the anticipated rate of crack growth. CPGs can be installed on a permanent basis to monitor an area where cracks are anticipated. Figure 4 illustrates the typical output of a CPG. The gage pattern shown has six individual conductive tracks extending between terminals at each end. Voltage or resistance measurements across these terminals indicate the number of tracks that have fractured. As the crack propagates in the material being tested, the conductive tracks of the CPG are fractured, resulting in an increase in the resistance between the terminals on the gage.\nFigure 4. Graph.

Displacement gauges manufactured based on different physical principles can have different measuring ranges, accuracies, and usage environments\u202fto serve applications with different purposes. \nMeasurements using displacement gauges can be classified into two broad categories: noncontact measurements using light or sound waves and contact measurements performed in direct contact with the target.(1) Figure 1 shows an example using contact-type displacement sensors to measure the crack opening of a concrete structure under load.(2) \nSource: FHWA. \nFigure 1. Photo. Displacement sensors used to measure crack openings.(2) \nPhysical Principle \nDisplacement gauges have been developed based on different physical principles. The noncontact type of displacement gauge is usually developed based on propagation and reflection of light or sound waves. For example, displacement may be measured based on the two-way travel time of either ultrasonic waves or laser beams. Displacement may also be based on the principle of triangulation to detect the difference in position of reflected laser beams on the light-receiving element. Figure 2 shows the physical principle of noncontact displacement sensors using twoway travel time. Other noncontact displacement gauges use different physical principles. For example, eddy current\u2013based displacement sensors measure voltage changes as a result of changes in the interaction of the magnetic field owing to different distances between the probe and target. \nSource: FHWA. \nd = distance between sensor and structural surface; v = speed of sound waves; \u0394t\u202f= two-way travel time of signal. \nFigure 2.

The movable soft iron core is attached to the measured surface by the arm. The device is attached to the reference surface. An alternating current (AC) voltage is supplied to the primary winding. Two voltages, VS1 and VS2, are obtained at the two secondary windings. Vd, the output voltage between the two secondary windings, is the difference between VS1 and VS2 and linearly related to the displacement of the soft iron core. Other contact types of displacement gauges can be developed based on different physical principles. \nSource: FHWA. \nFigure 3. Illustration.

Displacement gauges can be installed on a permanent basis to monitor an area where differential settlement is anticipated. \nData Processing \nA displacement gauge produces a voltage/resistance, light signal, or force/moment, which changes as a result of changing displacement.

When inspectors drill into a suspect member, they can feel the resistance against drilling if a hand crank drill is used and monitor the drilling shaving. Nowadays, large drill bits (i.e., 3/8 inch to 3/4 inch) are rarely used to drill through timber bridge elements due to their destructive nature. Drilling usually leaves a sizeable hole and sometimes extends entirely through members. It has largely been replaced with the resistance microdrilling technique, which is less subjective and minimally destructive.\nPhysical Principle\nAn inspector performs the visual inspection of drill shaving related to the presence of decay or void. Using a hand crank drill, the inspector can feel the resistance against drilling, which is proportional to the wood density.(1) The low-density regions can suggest the presence of decay or void. By feeling a sudden drop in the resistance against drilling and visually inspecting drill shaving, an inspector can confirm the presence of decay or void in wood members.\nData Acquisition\nWhile an electric power drill can be faster, a hand crank drill allows an inspector to feel resistance as he or she drills, which can help estimate the decay depth and shell thickness. Drill bits with a diameter of 3/8 inch to 3/4 inch are commonly used. When drilling, an inspector monitors wood shavings for potential decay and notes areas where drilling is easier. The growth features of wood, such as resin pockets and knots, should not be interpreted as deteriorated regions. After drilling, shell thickness can be estimated using a bent wire or thickness gauge inserted into the drilled hole.(1) Copper naphthalene should be applied to the decayed area to retard the decay progress. Precautions should be taken to avoid spillage into the environment surrounding the bridge. The drill hole should be filled with a wood dowel soaked in preservatives.(1) The drill bits should also be cleaned to avoid the transfer of microorganisms. For drilling vertical faces, drill at a slightly upward angle for drainage to flow away from the filled hole.(2)\nThe common areas for drilling are the ones more susceptible to moisture accumulation and decay, such as the following:(2)\nDeck planks at the bottom next to beams.\nBeams in the sides near the deck and at the bottom close to the pile/bent cap.\nCap on the top near beams and at the bottom close to the piles/bents.\nPile/bent on the top near the cap and at the bottom near the waterline or ground level.\nData Processing\nNo data processing is required\nData Interpretation\nAn inspector marks areas of the wood where drilling is easier.\nAdvantages\nThere are many advantages to drilling, including the following:\nSimple\nLow cost\nSamples obtained from the subsurface of wood members.\nLimitations\nDrilling can be subjective and is a destructive technique using drill bits ranging from 3/8 inch to 3/4 inch diameter.\n Drilling can be time-consuming and labor-intensive depending on the number of tests.\nDrilling does not provide quantitative information about the physical and mechanical properties of wood members.\nReferences\nWhite, R.

        "text": "NDE\nBridge\nDye Penetrant Testing (DPT)\nTechnology\nDye Penetrant Testing (DPT)\nExport PDF\nTarget of Investigation\nThe primary application of DPT for steel bridges is to detect and monitor cracks in steel bridge members, gusset plate connections, and welded details in the field. The technology relies on penetrant liquid being able to enter a crack and emerge at a later time due to capillary action. Consequently, subsurface cracks or volumetric weld defects (porosity, lack of fusion, slag inclusions, etc.) cannot be detected using DPT. Access is required to clean the surface, apply penetrant and developer, and visually observe results. Areas that are difficult to access or where other members interfere with access to the surface may be difficult to assess with DPT. Common field applications of the technology include detecting cracks at fatigue-prone details and verifying visual inspection results.\nDescription\nDye penetrant testing (DPT) is a nondestructive method for crack detection in metals. DPT is a process by which a liquid dye is applied to the surface to be inspected; this liquid dye seeps into cracks and other voids or depressions in the surface. The surface is then wiped clean, removing all of the dye from the surface. Dye that has penetrated into a crack is not removed by the cleaning and emerges from the crack due to capillary action. This results in a visible indication of the crack on the surface.(1,2)\nTo ensure that the indication is easy to observe visually, the color contrast between the liquid dye and the surface undergoing inspection may be enhanced. For typical field inspections of bridges, this is accomplished by applying a developer to the surface after it has been cleaned. Developers are typically white in color; the liquid dye is typically red. The color contrast between the white developer and the red dye ensures that crack indications will be easily observed by an inspector. \nAnother method of improving the contrast between an indication and the surface being inspected is to use fluorescent dye. A fluorescent dye contains particles that, when illuminated with ultraviolet light, emit intense visible spectrum light. This improves the light intensity contrast between the fluorescing dye crack indication, and the surface under inspection, which is not fluorescing. However, generally dark ambient light conditions (\u2264 2 fc) are required to observe the light contrasts between the dye and the surface being inspected.(1,2) Consequently, fluorescent DPT is not commonly used for bridges in the field.\nPhysical Principle \nDPT works on the physical principle of capillary action. Capillary action (or capillary motion) describes the ascension of a liquid along a surface in opposition to gravity. This occurs when the adhesive forces between a liquid and a solid surface exceeds the cohesive forces within the liquid itself. As a result, the liquid spreads along the solid surface and can overcome the gravitational forces to \u201cclimb\u201d along the surface in a vertical direction. For DPT, liquid confined within a crack emerges to the surface of the material, forming an indication of the presence of the crack on the surface of the material.\nData Acquisition\nData acquisition for DPT consists of cleaning the surface to be inspected, applying a colored or fluorescent liquid penetrant, applying a developer to improve contrast, and then interpreting indications of the dye penetrant emerging through the developer. Figures 1 through 4 demonstrate several steps in the procedure. The procedure begins with cleaning the surface of the material to remove coating and any debris and foreign material from the area to be assessed. Once the surface has been fully cleaned, a colored dye penetrant is applied in a thin coating on the surface (figure 1). The colored dye is allowed to rest on the surface for a \u201cdwell\u201d period lasting 10 to 30 minutes. This dwell period allows the dye to penetrate any discontinuities in the surface, e.g. cracks. Once the desired dwell time has passed, the surface is thoroughly cleaned with a cloth moistened with solvent to remove all dye from the surface (figure 2). Developer is then applied to the surface in a thin, even coat (figure 3). The developer is typically a white powdery coating that covers the surface and dries quickly. An additional dwell time of 5-15 minutes allows the penetrant the time necessary to emerge from cracks in the surface and form an indication on the surface of the material (figure 4).\nFigure 1. Photo. Applying Dye Penetrant to Surface\nFigure 2. Photo. Cleaning Surface to Remove Dye.\nFigure 3. Photo. Applying Developer to Provide Contrast with Dye Emerging from a Crack.\nFigure 4. Photo. Crack Indication Formed by Dye Emerging from Crack.\nData Processing \nThe data produced from a DPT inspection are visible indications on the surface of the material being tested. Indications are photographed and documented by notes or on an inspection report.\nData Interpretation \nData interpretation consists of visual observations of penetrant emerging from features on the surface of the material. Linear indications are generally interpreted as indicating cracks. Non-relevant indications are produced when dye becomes entrapped in a surface feature that is not a crack and emerges through the developer. Inadequate surface cleaning can result in non-relevant indications, as dye emerges from debris on the surface or from under coatings that have not been fully removed. Welds with surface relief due to undercut, surface porosity, or a rough weld bead may also produce non-relevant indications. \nAdvantages \nSimple to apply, minimal training required.\nRelatively easy data interpretation.\nLow cost.\nMaterials can be stored on inspection vehicle for later use.\nLimitations  \nRequires removing all coatings, compromising corrosion protection.\nRequires extensive surface preparation, potentially producing hazardous materials when lead paints are present.\nRequires long time intervals to apply (~30-60 minutes).\nLong dwell times (~10 minutes for penetrant to seep into cracks, and ~10 minutes for penetrant to appear through developer).\nDetects only surface-breaking cracks.\nReferences \nASTM, \u201cStandard Practice for Liquid Penetrant Testing,\u201d E1417-11, West Conshohocken, PA, 2011.\nASTM, \u201cStandard Practice for Liquid Penetrant Examination for General Industry,\u201d E165-12, West Conshohocken, PA, 2012.\nLast updated on July 26, 2021",

It has a variety of industrial applications, such as in the aerospace and petrochemical industries. ECA is very flexible, and a wide range of specimen shapes can be inspected. For bridge structures, ECA is carried out on ferromagnetic steel welds to inspect for defects and can be used for testing over typical bridge paints. ECA can also be used to estimate geometric parameters such as lift-off, coating thicknesses, and other dependent properties such as stress, related to either magnetic permeability or electrical conductivity, and temperature, related to electrical conductivity.(1)  \nDescription\nThe ECA is a newer technology that extends the principle of conventional eddy current testing (ET). ECA systems are generally made of a conformable eddy current array specifically designed for model-based inverse methods. Multivariate inverse methods convert the sensor response into absolute property estimates. Multiple sensor responses for each individual sensing element at each location are converted into estimates of several material properties at each location along the inspected surface of the material.  \nPhysical Principle \nECA is conceptually similar to conventional ET. For conventional ET, eddy currents are induced when an energized probe-coil is placed near the surface of a conductive material; ECA extends this concept and uses an array of multiple coils instead of only a single coil.  The coil current must be alternating current (AC) since a time-dependent magnetic field is required to induce or generate electrical currents. The eddy currents induced at the surface of the test material are time varying and have magnitude and phase. Eddy currents are proportional to the electrical conductivity of the material. Material properties and discontinuities such as cracks disturb the eddy current trajectories, affecting the magnitude and phase of the induced current. The coils sense the magnetic field induced by these currents, producing a complex voltage in the coils. \nData Acquisition\nSensor arrays are fabricated on a thin flexible printed circuit board substrate. This allows sensors to conform to the shape of a specimen. Data acquisition consists of electronics to drive sensor arrays and measure the response of the individual array coils (figures 1 and 2).\nSensor arrays can measure multiple quantities, such as lift-off (distance from the array coil to the specimen), permeability, and other material properties. Sensor coils can be incorporated with encoders to measure the movement of the coils and correlate measured data with spatial position on a specimen. Equipment is generally designed for laboratory and industrial applications.\nFigure 1. Photo. Technician Performing Inspection with Eddy Current Array.\nFigure 2. Photo. Eddy Current Array Instrument and Sensor.\nData Processing \nData processing is done internally within the instrument hardware and software. System software uses calibrated look-up tables to relate measured signals to desired physical parameters. With the use of position encoders, data can be presented with a spatial reference. Data can be stored for offline processing and provides a permanent record.\nData Interpretation \nData is interpreted by the operator while using the device. Signal output is observed on the instrument display and the operator uses judgment to determine the meaning of the signal. Operating equipment and interpreting data requires significant skill for an operator. Figure 3 shows sample ECA testing results for estimating lift-off and magnetic permeability.\nFigure 3. Contour Maps. Data Output showing Lift-Off (left) and Permeability (right).\nSignal output can be dependent on the movement of the probe over the specimen surface. Irregular surfaces or inconsistent movement of a probe (e.g., lifting the probe off the surface or tilting the probe) can produce signals that could be interpreted as defects. Skilled operators can consistently scan specimens and apply judgment as to the nature of the output signal.\nAdvantages \nCan detect near-surface defects through paint.\nProvides a C-scan type of image of a defect.\nCan measure multiple physical parameters.\nCan compensate for lift-off and material property variations better than conventional eddy current.\nLimitations  \nResults influenced by magnetic properties of weld materials.\nResults affected by probe orientation during scanning.\nRequires operator experience and skill.\nCostly equipment.\nLimited use in difficult access areas due to probe size.\nReferences \nASTM, Standard Guide for Eddy Current Testing of Electrically Conducting Materials Using Conformable Sensor Arrays, E2884-13e1, ASTM International, Conshohcken, PA, 2013.\nLast updated on May 19, 2021",

        "text": "NDE\nBridge\nEddy Current Testing (ECT)\nTechnology\nEddy Current Testing (ECT)\nExport PDF\nTarget of Investigation\nECT is used to detect cracks in steel bridge members. Due to the magnetic properties of steel, only surface breaking or near surface-breaking cracks can be detected. The technology can be effective for detecting cracks in welds; however, special probes must be used due to complex magnetic and microstructural properties associated with the weld and the surrounding heat affected zone (HAZ). \nDescription\nECT works by scanning a small electromagnetic probe across the surface of a material. The signal produced by the probe is displayed in real-time on an instrument screen, and changes in the signals are produced when the probe scans across a discontinuity in the material. Inspectors interpret the changes in the signal produced by the probe to identify cracks or other defects.\nThe ECT method is used to inspect conductive materials to detect surface or near-surface cracks. ECT is used to detect cracks in a wide variety of metal components, such as airplane landing gear, turbine engines, heat exchanger tubing, pipes, and rods. For bridges, ECT is applied to detect surface-breaking cracks in steel components.\nPhysical Principle \nThe basic principle of ECT is to induce electrical currents in a conductive material and analyze perturbations in the current flow caused by discontinuities in the material. The induced currents flow in a circular pattern and are referred to as eddy currents. Eddy currents are generated by a probe consisting of one or more wire coils excited with alternating currents at a regulated frequency. This results in a dynamic expanding and collapsing magnetic field surrounding the coil. When an electrically conductive material is placed within the magnetic field, eddy currents are induced in the material through electromagnetic induction. The currents flowing in the material create a secondary magnetic field that opposes the primary magnetic field of the coil, affecting the impedance of the coil. The presence of a discontinuity, defect, or irregularity in the grain structure of the material disrupts the flow of the current in the material; therefore, changes in the impedance of the coil are produced. Impedance changes in the coil are analyzed and interpreted to detect defects in the material.\nProbes must be oriented such that a crack is perpendicular to the flow of current in the material and the crack interrupts the current flow. Current flow in the material is parallel to the flow of current in the probe coil with current flow in the opposite direction. In other words, the path of current at the surface of the material is an \u201cimage\u201d of the coil with opposing current direction.\nThe sensitivity of eddy current inspection depends on the eddy current density at the flaw location. Eddy current density decreases with increasing depth into the material under test due to the skin effect. The depth of penetration decreases with increasing frequency, conductivity, and magnetic permeability. \nThe density of currents in a conductive material can be described by the standard depth of penetration equation (figure 1), which determines the depth into the material at which the density of current is reduced to 1/e (i.e., ~37 percent) relative to the density at the surface.\nFigure 1. Equation. Standard Depth of Penetration.\nWhere:\nd =  skin depth of penetration (mm).\nf  =  excitation frequency (Hz).\nm = magnetic permeability (H/mm).\ns = electrical conductivity (%IACS).\nIACS = International Annealed Copper Standard.\nWhen attempting to locate flaws, a frequency is selected that places the expected flaw depth within one standard depth of penetration into the material; this ensures the density of current in the material is sufficient to affect the impedance of the coil and produce a flaw indication. For ferromagnetic materials (e.g., steel), permeability values are high; as a result, the standard skin depth is very small, typically less than 1-3 mm depending on the frequency used. ECT in steel can detect only surface-breaking cracks or near surface-breaking cracks. Non-ferromagnetic materials (e.g., aluminum) have a relative permeability of approximately 1 mm; therefore, skin depths are larger and subsurface flaws may be detected.  \nECT is sometimes used to determine the conductivity of materials or to differentiate one metal from another based on the electrical properties of the material. For this application, the test frequency is often set such that three times the standard skin depth calculated from the preceding equation is less than the thickness of the material. This ensures the material boundaries will not affect the ECT because current density is reduced to 1/e3 (~5 percent) in the area of the boundary.\nThe density of current in the material depends on the intensity of the magnetic field inducing the current. Magnetic fields attenuate exponentially in air, such that the distance from the probe coil to the surface of the material under test is an important test parameter. This effect is referred to as the \u201clift-off factor\u201d\u2014the loss in signal strength resulting from the distance between the probe coil and the surface of the material under test. In general, uniform and very small lift-off values are preferred for achieving better detection sensitivity to flaws. For steel bridges, coating on the steel causes lift-off of the sensor, decreasing signal intensity relative to uncoated steel. This affect can be mitigated by proper calibration that includes similar lift-off of the probe from the surface of the material.(1,2)\nData Acquisition\nData acquisition for ECT includes an ECT instrument and an appropriate hand-held probe. Relatively low cost, battery-operated portable instruments are available that make the technology practical for use on bridges (figure 2). Test results are displayed on the ECT instrument in real-time for interpretation in the field. \nECT probes are produced in a variety of configurations suitable for different applications.  Several typical probes are shown in figure 3. Probes with right-angle heads are designed for inspecting the inside of bolt holes (figure 3, left). For example, very small probes are designed for applications where access is limited (figure 3, center). For inspection of welds, a differential probe with two probe coils is typically used (figure 3, right) that reduces the effect of material property variations on the probe output. \nFigure 2. Photo. ECT Instrument.\nFigure 3. Photo. ECT Probes.\nData Processing \nMinimal data processing is required for ECT because the impedance signal is analyzed directly to detect cracks. Analog frequency and time-based filters are commonly used to improve signal quality.\nData Interpretation \nAn operator completes the interpretation of data from ECT in real-time during an inspection. The signal output is analyzed as the probe is scanned across the surface of the material. The signal is analyzed to determine if signal variations represent a relevant indication, such as a crack, or if signal variations represent non-relevant indications, such as probe lift off, non-crack surface irregularities, or material property variations. \nData are plotted using an impedance plane display or a time series display. An impedance plane display plots the individual components of the impedance signal (reactance and resistance) as x-y coordinates. A time series display plots the individual components of the impedance separately against a time, sample number, or distance axis. Figure 4 shows an example of a time series display in which the probe resistance is plotted against a distance axis. The signal shown in figure 4 results from scanning the probe over a specimen with three EDM notches of different depths, and illustrates the signal displacement observed by the operator as the probe is scanned across each notch. Figure 5 shows a pencil ECT probe being used to inspect the web of a girder.\nFigure 4. Graph. ECT Signal with Defect Indications.\nFigure 5. Digital photo. A Pencil Probe (ECT) Placed on Web of a Girder to Detect Defects.\nSignal output can be dependent on the movement of the probe over the specimen surface.  Irregular surfaces or inconsistent movement of a probe (e.g., lifting the probe off the surface or tilting the probe) can produce signals that may be interpreted as defects. Skilled operators can consistently scan specimens and use judgment to determine the nature of the output signal.\nAdvantages \nLow-cost, portable instrumentation.\nMinimal surface preparation.\nDoes not require coating removal like other crack detection technologies such as dye penetrant testing (PT), ultrasonics (UT), or magnetic particle testing (MT).\nCan detect paint thickness variations.\nLimitations  \nDetects only surface-breaking cracks.\nMagnetic properties of weld materials can influence results.\nMethod requires skill by the operator in order to obtain reliable results.\nReferences \nAmerican Society of Nondestructive Testing (ASNT) Handbook, 3rd Edition, Vol. 5, 2005.\nHagemaier, J.D., Fundamentals of Eddy Current Testing, December, 1990.\nLast updated on April 20, 2021",

The electrical resistivity method can be used to evaluate the existence of such corrosive environment. Damaged and cracked areas, due to increased porosity, will form preferential paths for fluid and ion flow. This will lead to higher moisture and chloride concentrations and higher concrete electrical conductivity, manifesting as a lower electrical resistivity. The lower the electrical resistivity of the concrete, the higher the current passing between anodic and cathodic areas of the reinforcement steel will be.(1) Several studies have established approximate relationships between the electrical resistivity and the corrosion rate of steel reinforcement (table 1).\nTable 1. Electrical Resistivity and Corresponding Corrosion Rates for Steel-reinforced Concrete.(1)\nElectrical Resistivity (K\u03a9*cm) Corrosion Rate\n< 5 Very High\n5 - 10 High\n10 - 20 Moderate - Low\n>  20 Low\nThe Wenner probe is a commonly used electrical resistivity probe (figure 1). The probe has four electrodes. Figure 2 shows electrical resistivity measurement being conducted on a concrete bridge deck.\nFigure 1. Photo. Electrical Resistivity (Wenner) Probe with Four Electrodes.(1)\nFigure 2. Photo. Conducting Electrical Resistivity Measurement.(2)\nPhysical Principle \nElectrical resistivity or its reciprocal, electrical conductivity, is an intrinsic property that quantifies the ability of a given material to oppose or conduct electric current. The standard SI unit of electrical resistivity is ohm-meter (\u03a9-m) although other units like ohm-centimeter (\u03a9-cm) are also used. Surface electrical resistivity of a steel-reinforced concrete element (typically, the cover of a steel-reinforced concrete slab or deck) is an indicator of concrete corrosive environment.\nTo conduct electrical resistivity tests, the voltage and current are measured at the surface of the object under investigation using a certain layout of electrodes. The most simple and common electrode layout in civil engineering applications is the Wenner array (figure 3). The Wenner array uses four in-line electrodes that are equally spaced.(1) A current is applied between the two outer electrodes, and the potential is measured across the two inner ones. The resistivity is then calculated (figure 4).\nFigure 3. Illustration. Physical Principle of Electrical Resistivity Measurement.(1)\nFigure 4. Equation. Electrical Resistivity.(2)\nWhere:\n\u03c1 = Resistivity (\u03a9-m or \u03a9-cm).\n\u03b1 = Electrode separation (m).\nV = Voltage (V).\nI = Current (amp).\nBuilding materials such as concrete, cement, or wood are ion conductors, which means that electrical conduction happens through the interconnected pore space. The resistivity of fully saturated concrete is between 1 and 10 k\u2126-cm, depending on the conductivity of the pore fluid. When concrete is oven dried, its electrical resistivity can be 100 k\u2126-cm or more, causing it to act as an insulator. The electrical resistivity of concrete affects the ionic current flow between the anode and cathode and the rate at which corrosion can occur. Dry concrete has high electrical resistivity and, thus, will impede the current flow and inhibit corrosion, whereas highly permeable and moist concrete has low electrical resistivity and a high likelihood of corrosion. As concrete is a composite material, its electrical resistivity will always depend upon its porosity, pore size distribution, cement chemistry, water/cement ratio, and types and concentrations of admixtures. The resistivity is also a function of the ion type and content of the saturation fluid.(3,4). Drying the concrete surface, carbonation, and the presence of steel reinforcement in the vicinity of the electrodes significantly affect resistivity measurements.\nData Acquisition\nCurrently, there is no ASTM or other standard for measuring resistivity of concrete using a Wenner array. ASTM G57-06, Standard Test Method for Field Measurement of Soil Resistivity Using the Wenner Four-Electrode Method, is a similar application to concrete testing, but there are differences.\nFor electrical resistivity measurements, galvanic contact has to be ensured between the electrodes and the concrete. If the surface of concrete is dry, the concrete has to be pre-wetted with water, contact graphite gel, or pastes, or the electrodes must be kept moist.\nThe following steps explain the general procedure for electrical resistivity measurements:\nA 2-ft by 2-ft survey grid is laid out on the surface of concrete deck. Each grid point is used as the central point of a Wenner probe.\nThe sponges on all four electrodes are fully saturated with soapy water to assure electrical coupling between the electrodes and concrete.\nThe spots for electrodes sitting on a concrete surface are wetted by soapy water before the electrodes are placed on it to ensure good contact between the electrodes and the concrete surface. The key is to keep the sponges wet all the times.\nThe resistivity values are measured and stored in a control unit.\nData Processing \nData processing is simple and consists of generating a contour map of the measured electrical resistivity data to report the spatial distribution of the resistivity values.\nData Interpretation \nAreas with low resistivity describe highly corrosive environment facilitating high corrosion rates, whereas areas with a high resistivity describe an environment that does not facilitate corrosion. In Figure 5, the electrical resistivity is correlated to the corrosion rate according to Table 1 (See Description).\nFigure 5. Contour Map. Electrical Resistivity Measurements.(2)\nAdvantages \nLow to medium level of expertise required for equipment setup and data collection.\nLow-cost testing.\nSimple data processing and presentation.\nTesting is repeatable with low coefficient of variation.\nLimitations  \nNot a direct measurement of corrosion, like corrosion rate or corrosion activity.\nTime consuming and labor intensive on large bridge decks since data collection is often done manually.\nChallenging data interpretation since ER is impacted by a number of environmental parameters (e.g., moisture and salt content, porosity), and their impacts on the measured data cannot be delineated. \nMeasurements on concrete elements with electrically isolating coatings or overlays, like asphalt overlays on bridge decks, provide meaningless results.\nReferences \nGucunski, N., et. al., Nondestructive Testing to Identify Concrete Bridge Deck Deterioration, Report S2-Ro6A-RR-1, SHRP2 Renewal Research, Transportation Research Board, 2013.\nGucunski, N., et.al., Comprehensive Bridge Deck Deterioration Mapping of Nine Bridges by Nondestructive Evaluation Technologies, Project SPR-NDEB(90)-8H-00, Center for Advanced Infrastructure and Transportation, Rutgers University, January, 2011.\nLast updated on August 18, 2022",

The corrosion rate is very important for determining how fast a concrete member is deteriorating; this determination is not possible with either the ER or HCP technologies. GPM is also advantageous in corrosion risk assessment over HCP measurement in situations when concrete is wet, dense, or polymer-modified, and thus the access to oxygen is limited.(1)\nDescription\nGPM is an electrochemical NDE technology used for rapid assessment of rebar corrosion, primarily to estimate the corrosion rate for steel rebars. GPM is based on the polarization of rebar using a small current pulse and measurement in the potential change.(2) GPM uses an electrode device positioned on a concrete surface and a reference electrode attached directly to the steel reinforcement to determine the half-cell potential, corrosion rate, and resistance between the reinforcement and device (figure 1).\nFigure 1. Photo. Galvanostatic Pulse Measurement with Close Up of Control Unit.\nPhysical Principle \nThe GPM corrosion assessment is based on the measurement of the current required to change the potential difference between the reinforcement and a standard reference electrode. The current is a result flow of electrons from the anodic and cathodic sides in concrete. The anodic side is a corroding rebar where there is surplus of electrons on the base metal as a result of releasing metal ions into an electrolytically conducting liquid. Those excess electrons flow to a cathodic side, concrete with oxidizing agents in the liquid, inducing a corrosion current between the two sides. Knowing the current and voltage allows an inspector to determine the polarization resistance, which is related to the rate of corrosion. The GPM test is conducted by first applying to counter electrode a number of anodic DC pulses (5-400\u00b5A). The first, stronger pulse is between 3 to 60 seconds, and its intensity will primarily depend on the properties of the object under investigation. Several smaller consecutive pulses of gradually increased intensity may follow the first pulse. The objective of applying DC pulses is to obtain a sufficiently high polarization, at which point potential variations are recorded by means of a reference electrode (figure 2). Noncorroding or passive reinforcement possesses no current and thus will have a high resistance to current flow which is reflected in a potential shift of around 100 mV.(3) Active corrosion is likely when the potential shift gets smaller. This can be also explained as an actively corroding system can quickly compensate for a removal of electrons due to the corrosion reaction or polarization achieved by the current pulse remains low in an actively corroding area.\nFigure 2. Composite Graph. Galvanostatic Pulse Measurement of Corrosion Activity.\nData Acquisition\nFor data collection using the galvanostatic pulse method on concrete pavement, follow the procedure described in ASTM C876-09, Standard Test Method for Corrosion Potentials of Uncoated Reinforcing Steel in Concrete. The procedure is summarized as follows:(4)\nIdentify points or lay out a grid for data collection on the pavement, ensuring that points are not so close together that measurements overlap and are not so far apart that localized corrosion is missed.\nElectrically connect the reinforcing steel to the positive lead of the system (figure 3). The following are typical steps to accomplish this procedure:\nLocate the steel using a rebar locator, drill down to the reinforcement, and connect a lead wire to the steel using a self-tapping screw drilled into the rebar.\nEnsure all measurement locations are electrically continuous with this tap.\nConfirm that the entire survey area is covered; this may require multiple taps and corresponding measurement areas.\n\u00a9 2015 N. Gucunski/Rutgers CAIT.\nFigure 3. Photo. Electrical connection to exposed reinforcement steel.(1)\nElectrically connect the reference electrode to the negative lead of the system.\nWet the contact sponge of the reference and counter electrodes to ensure good electrical contact with the concrete pavement; prewetting can also be used if conditions allow. The following steps describe the prewetting process:\nWet the entire surface of the testing locations but make sure no free surface water remains between test locations before taking measurements.\nPlace a prewetted sponge on each test location before taking measurements and leave it in place for the duration of collection at that location.\nPlace the reference electrode on the test point (figure 4).\n\u00a9 2015 N. Gucunski/Rutgers CAIT.\nFigure 4. Photo. Data collection with galvanostatic pulse system.\nAdjust the current pulse amplitude with one strong and then several shorter pulses until the reinforcing steel reaches a sufficiently high polarization.\nRecord the potential variations using a handheld computer with data acquisition software.\nMove to the next test point and repeat the collection procedure.\nAfter testing is completed, patch all tap locations.\nData Processing \nTypically, no processing is performed for data collected using the galvanostatic pulse method. The system usually has contour-mapping software for gridding and plotting data for visualization purposes. The slope of the potential\u2013time curve measured during the current pulse can be used to provide information about the corrosion state of the steel reinforcement, and the potential data can be used to obtain a measure of the concrete ER for a given concrete cover depth.\nData Interpretation \nFigure 5 and figure 6 are typical contour maps from a galvanostatic pulse method survey. Figure 5 is an ER map that shows values ranging from 5 to 63 k\u03a9. Areas with lower ER values indicate a higher probability of a corrosive environment from the intrusion of moisture, chlorides, and salts in the concrete. Areas with higher ER values indicate a noncorrosive environment.\n\u00a9 2015 TRB.\n1 ft = 0.3 m.\nFigure 5. Contour map.

A more detailed knowledge of the daily and seasonal changes in the corrosion rate is required to obtain lifetime predictions of service life and condition.

It can be used to identify and map areas with a high likelihood of corrosion-based deterioration, assess construction quality, determine structural reinforcement layout, and estimate thickness of the deck, overlays, or reinforcement cover.It can also be used for bridge deck and tunnel linings condition assessment, pavement layer thickness measurements, mine detection, archeological investigations, geophysical investigations, borehole inspection, building inspection, etc. Typical GPR applications for bridge elements include the following:(1)\nMeasuring concrete cover and mapping rebar configuration.\nAssessing potential for concrete deterioration and delamination.\nMeasuring deck thickness and mapping cables, conduits, other embedded objects.\nIdentifying heterogeneity in concrete such as rock pockets, honeycombing, and voids.\nDescription\nA GPR antenna transmits high-frequency EM waves into the structure and detects the reflected signals. GPR is an accepted technology to diagnose existing structures with apparent deteriorations. GPR is best utilized as a complementary tool in the engineer\u2019s toolbox, rather than as a technology that provides a complete solution to every problem as a stand-alone application. It can be implemented as ground-coupled (figure 1) or air-coupled (figure 2) GPR.\nFigure 1. Photo. Data Collection on a Bridge Deck Using Ground-Coupled GPR.\nFigure2. Photo. Data Collection on a Bridge Deck Using Air-Coupled GPR.\nPhysical Principle \nGPR uses electromagnetic (EM) wave pulses in the microwave band of the radio spectrum to image the subsurface. GPR detects the reflected signals from reflectors (boundaries related to a mismatch of electric properties) in subsurface structures.  \nA GPR antenna transmits high-frequency EM waves into the structure. A portion of the energy reflected back to the surface from any reflector, such as a rebar or an anomaly, is received by the antenna (figure 3). The remainder of the energy penetrates beneath this interface and is reflected back to the receiver from other interfaces until the transmitted energy diminishes. In the case of an air-coupled antenna, typically suspended 1 to 2 ft above ground, the part of the trace before the first strong reflection represents the travel of EM waves through air.\nFigure 3. Illustration. Physical Principle of GPR.\nThe bridge deck condition is defined by the signals returned to the receiver; the speed at which they return; and other properties of the signal, including amplitude, attenuation, signal polarity, and wavelength. The signal responses are different for various interfaces due to the contrast in the electrical properties of adjacent layers. The electrical properties of primary interest are the electrical conductivity (inverse of resistivity) and relative dielectric permittivity (dielectric constant). These two properties govern the ability of the EM energy to penetrate that particular medium and the speed at which EM waves propagate through the medium, respectively. The contrast in the dielectric constant between adjacent materials dictates the strength of the reflected energy to the surface.\nEM waves cannot penetrate into metals (e.g., rebar or metallic expansion joints). Even dense wire screens and thin foils are impermeable to EM waves. The penetration of the GPR\u2019s EM waves is fair to good in most construction materials (concrete, hot mix asphalt, or engineered pavement soils). GPR signal\u2019s penetration in concrete that is moist and high in free chloride ions (e.g., fresh concrete) or other conductive materials can be adversely affected. For example, the GPR signal will be highly attenuated in a reinforced concrete deck that has undergone severe corrosion induced deterioration, and limit the depth of assessment. Dielectric constant for typical construction materials, including concrete, are shown in the following table 1.\nTable 1. Relative Dielectric Permittivity for Different Materials.\nMaterial Dielectric Constant*\nAir 1\nClay 25-40\nConcrete 8-10\nCrushed base 6-8\nGravel 4-7\nHot mix asphalt 4-8\nIce 4\nInsulation board 2-2.5\nSand 4-6\nSilt 16-30\nSilty sand 7-10\nWater (fresh) 81\n*Moisture can significantly increase the dielectric values (e.g., for gravel it may go from 5 to above 20)\nData Acquisition\nData collection with GPR should be carried out by an experienced and qualified operator. The following list comprises the general steps required to achieve quality results on bridge decks:\nTurn on the GPR system, and allow it to stabilize (warm up) while adjusting settings and calibrating survey wheel/distance measuring instrument.\nCalibrate survey wheel/distance measurement instrument (DMI) on a fixed distance over the deck\u2019s surface, roughly one-third to one-half of the deck length.\nSet up signal position for top of scan, gain, vertical high-pass (HP), and low-pass (LP) filters based on recommendations from the manufacturer.\nSet up GPR sampling window for sufficient time range (8 to 12 ns for a ground-coupled, and up to 40 ns for an air-coupled antenna), vertical sampling (512 samples/scan, but ranging from 256 to 1024), scan rate (100 to 400 scans/second), and spatial scan density (24 to 60 scans/ft for a ground-coupled, and about 12 scans/ft for an air-coupled antenna).\nCollect data and perform quality control review of onscreen output that is sent to permanent storage (hard drive, flash drive, memory stick, or other medium).\nSimple data collection on a bridge deck can be accomplished on a series of lines spaced about 2 ft apart, using a hand-pushed or pulled cart with an encoder-based wheel or a vehicle mounted air-coupled antenna. Smaller carts allow access into tighter confines (e.g., where deck meets curb, parapet, jersey barriers, etc.). The GPR survey lines should be perpendicular to the direction of top reinforcement. If the survey is conducted in the direction parallel to the orientation of the top reinforcement, the survey should be conducted with two antennas of dual polarization. For concrete girders (precast prestressed, post-tensioned, cast-in-place concrete girders), GPR field data are typically collected at a spacing equal to or less than the rebar spacing within the girder. A 1-ft by 1-ft (or more closely spaced) grid is usually used to map voids and delamination, and to image, locate, and map reinforcement within the girder and the layout of any embedded conduits, post-tensioned cables, or prestressing strands. Position and depth can be determined reasonably accurately if the measurements are performed properly.\nData Processing \nThe attenuation of the GPR signal at the top rebar level is normally used to represent the condition of the deck.(1) When the antenna is centered directly above the rebar, the highest amplitude return for the area near the rebar is obtained. This amplitude will be highest when the deck is in good condition and lowest when delamination and corrosion is present. Amplitudes for all points are normalized with respect to the best possible condition to obtain the plot of attenuation.\nThe first step in the processing sequence is the automatic rebar reflection picking, often accompanied by verifying the picks using interactive interpretation. The result of the process is a table of rebar position (depth) and amplitude of reflection (figure 4). Since the rebar depth can significantly influence signal attenuation, measured reflection amplitudes are corrected for rebar depth variations. Once the attenuation map is completed, a unique deterioration threshold is established using ground truth, such as cores or other NDE methods to provide the results interpretation. For example, impact echo or chain drag data can be used to establish thresholds of delamination, or electrical resistivity data to establish thresholds of corrosive environment.\nFigure 4. Composite Graph. 2D Radargram from a Ground-Coupled Antenna Surevy Showing Rebar \u201cPicks\u201d with Visibly Deteriorated Areas Missing Automatic \u201cPicks.\u201d\nBecause the air-coupled antenna is suspended above the ground surface, the energy transmitted from the antenna is more dispersed as it reaches the surface of the tested object. As a result, the rebars clearly visible as individual hyperbolas in the ground-coupled antenna data, appear as a layer in the air-coupled antenna data. This is illustrated in figure 5 as a \u201crebar layer\u201d instead of individual rebars.\nFigure 5. Composite Graph. 2D Radargram from an Air-Coupled Antenna Survey Showing the Identified Rebar Layer.\nData Interpretation \nData interpretation is performed on a contour map by using certain attenuation thresholds (figure 6). When the concrete cover thickness varies significantly, the depth-corrected attenuation map provides more accurate description about the deck condition, in comparison to the simple amplitude mapping technique.\nFigure 6. Contour Map. GPR Attenuation-based Map with Concrete Deterioration Grading.\nAs illustrated in figure 7, ground- and air-coupled antennas can provide similar pictures of the condition of a bridge deck. The attenuation maps were generated for the data collected by three antennas: 1.5 GHz and 2.6 GHz ground-coupled antennas, and a 2.0 GHz air-coupled antenna. All three antennas identify, in general, same areas of likely deterioration. (Note a slight difference in the size of surveyed sections by the three antennas.)

It can be used to identify and map areas with a high likelihood of corrosion-based deterioration, assess construction quality, determine structural reinforcement layout, and estimate thickness of the deck, overlays, or reinforcement cover. It can also be used for bridge deck and tunnel linings condition assessment, pavement layer thickness measurements, mine detection, archeological investigations, geophysical investigations, borehole inspection, building inspection, etc. Typical GPR applications for bridge elements include the following:(1)\nMeasuring concrete cover and mapping rebar configuration.\nAssessing potential for concrete deterioration and delamination.\nMeasuring deck thickness and mapping cables, conduits, other embedded objects.\nIdentifying heterogeneity in concrete such as rock pockets, honeycombing, and voids.\nDescription\nA GPR antenna transmits high-frequency EM waves into the structure and detects the reflected signals. GPR is an accepted technology to diagnose existing structures with apparent deteriorations. GPR is best utilized as a complementary tool in the engineer\u2019s toolbox, rather than as a technology that provides a complete solution to every problem as a stand-alone application. It can be implemented as ground-coupled (figure 1) or air-coupled (figure 2) GPR.\nFigure 1. Photo. Data Collection on a Bridge Deck Using Ground-Coupled GPR.\nFigure2. Photo. Data Collection on a Bridge Deck Using Air-Coupled GPR.\nPhysical Principle \nGPR uses electromagnetic (EM) wave pulses in the microwave band of the radio spectrum to image the subsurface. GPR detects the reflected signals from reflectors (boundaries related to a mismatch of electric properties) in subsurface structures.  \nA GPR antenna transmits high-frequency EM waves into the structure. A portion of the energy reflected back to the surface from any reflector, such as a rebar or an anomaly, is received by the antenna (figure 3). The remainder of the energy penetrates beneath this interface and is reflected back to the receiver from other interfaces until the transmitted energy diminishes. In the case of an air-coupled antenna, typically suspended 1 to 2 ft above ground, the part of the trace before the first strong reflection represents the travel of EM waves through air.\nFigure 3. Illustration. Physical Principle of GPR.\nThe bridge deck condition is defined by the signals returned to the receiver; the speed at which they return; and other properties of the signal, including amplitude, attenuation, signal polarity, and wavelength. The signal responses are different for various interfaces due to the contrast in the electrical properties of adjacent layers. The electrical properties of primary interest are the electrical conductivity (inverse of resistivity) and relative dielectric permittivity (dielectric constant). These two properties govern the ability of the EM energy to penetrate that particular medium and the speed at which EM waves propagate through the medium, respectively. The contrast in the dielectric constant between adjacent materials dictates the strength of the reflected energy to the surface.\nEM waves cannot penetrate into metals (e.g., rebar or metallic expansion joints). Even dense wire screens and thin foils are impermeable to EM waves. The penetration of the GPR\u2019s EM waves is fair to good in most construction materials (concrete, hot mix asphalt, or engineered pavement soils). GPR signal\u2019s penetration in concrete that is moist and high in free chloride ions (e.g., fresh concrete) or other conductive materials can be adversely affected. For example, the GPR signal will be highly attenuated in a reinforced concrete deck that has undergone severe corrosion induced deterioration, and limit the depth of assessment. Dielectric constant for typical construction materials, including concrete, are shown in the following table 1.\nTable 1. Relative Dielectric Permittivity for Different Materials.\nMaterial Dielectric Constant*\nAir 1\nClay 25-40\nConcrete 8-10\nCrushed base 6-8\nGravel 4-7\nHot mix asphalt 4-8\nIce 4\nInsulation board 2-2.5\nSand 4-6\nSilt 16-30\nSilty sand 7-10\nWater (fresh) 81\n*Moisture can significantly increase the dielectric values (e.g., for gravel it may go from 5 to above 20)\nData Acquisition\nData collection with GPR should be carried out by an experienced and qualified operator. The following list comprises the general steps required to achieve quality results on bridge decks:\nTurn on the GPR system, and allow it to stabilize (warm up) while adjusting settings and calibrating survey wheel/distance measuring instrument.\nCalibrate survey wheel/distance measurement instrument (DMI) on a fixed distance over the deck\u2019s surface, roughly one-third to one-half of the deck length.\nSet up signal position for top of scan, gain, vertical high-pass (HP), and low-pass (LP) filters based on recommendations from the manufacturer.\nSet up GPR sampling window for sufficient time range (8 to 12 ns for a ground-coupled, and up to 40 ns for an air-coupled antenna), vertical sampling (512 samples/scan, but ranging from 256 to 1024), scan rate (100 to 400 scans/second), and spatial scan density (24 to 60 scans/ft for a ground-coupled, and about 12 scans/ft for an air-coupled antenna).\nCollect data and perform quality control review of onscreen output that is sent to permanent storage (hard drive, flash drive, memory stick, or other medium).\nSimple data collection on a bridge deck can be accomplished on a series of lines spaced about 2 ft apart, using a hand-pushed or pulled cart with an encoder-based wheel or a vehicle mounted air-coupled antenna. Smaller carts allow access into tighter confines (e.g., where deck meets curb, parapet, jersey barriers, etc.). The GPR survey lines should be perpendicular to the direction of top reinforcement. If the survey is conducted in the direction parallel to the orientation of the top reinforcement, the survey should be conducted with two antennas of dual polarization. For concrete girders (precast prestressed, post-tensioned, cast-in-place concrete girders), GPR field data are typically collected at a spacing equal to or less than the rebar spacing within the girder. A 1-ft by 1-ft (or more closely spaced) grid is usually used to map voids and delamination, and to image, locate, and map reinforcement within the girder and the layout of any embedded conduits, post-tensioned cables, or prestressing strands. Position and depth can be determined reasonably accurately if the measurements are performed properly.\nData Processing \nMost software used for identifying and mapping reinforcement provide algorithms that automatically tag, or \u201cpick,\u201d the maximum or peak hyperbolic amplitude coinciding with the GPR measurement directly above each bar, conduit, or cable in either the upper or lower rebar mats (figure 4). The \u201cpicks\u201d associated with individual rebars can be inspected and manually modified as needed. Two-way travel time, velocity, and x- and y- coordinates for each \u201cpick\u201d are output, all information needed for the mapping software.\nFigure 4. Radargram. 2D Radargram (B-Scan) from a Ground-Coupled GPR Antenna on a Concrete Bridge Deck.\n3D imaging programs are also used to identify layout, relative location, and depth of individual or groups of bars, conduits, or cables. These 3D software packages generally allow migration, a process which refocuses GPR energy to its point of origination. The main purpose of migration is to represent a point-scatterer, such as a rebar, as a dot (figure 5) rather than a hyperbola (figure 4). Migration can also be used to estimate the average depth to a point target (rebar, conduit) from the surface to the depth of the migrated (refocused) objects.\nFigure 5. Composite Graph. Top (red) and Bottom (blue) Mat Rebar \u201cPicks\u201d. Map of Measured Two-Way Travel Time, x- and y-coordinates, and User-Calculated Data (Velocity of GPR through Concrete or Rebar Depth/Concrete Cover).\nBecause the air-coupled antenna is suspended above the ground surface, the energy transmitted from the antenna is more dispersed as it reaches the surface of the tested object. As a result, the rebars clearly visible as individual hyperbolas in the ground-coupled antenna data, appear as a layer in the air-coupled antenna data. This is illustrated in figure 6 as a \u201crebar layer\u201d instead of individual rebars.\nFigure 6. Composite Graph. 2D Radargram from an Air-Coupled Antenna Survey Showing the Identified Rebar Layer.\nData Interpretation \nUsing dedicated software, x- and y-coordinates from each hyperbolic maxima are matched with a measure of two-way travel time and velocity of propagation of electromagnetic waves. This velocity, along with the two-wave travel time, is used to calculate a rebar, conduit, or cable depth. It is desirable to calibrate the results using cores or drill holes directly from the concrete surface to the top of a bar selected.\nWhen imaging software is used, 2D plan view maps or 3D transparency maps can also be used to better illustrate how rebars, conduits, or cables are laid out within the reinforced concrete deck (figure 7).\nFigure 7.

        "text": "NDE\nBridge\nGround Penetrating Radar\nTechnology\nGround Penetrating Radar\nExport PDF\nTarget of investigations\nGround penetrating radar (GPR) is beneficial in identifying the presence of subsurface features with dielectric constants different from the rest of the wood. Features include moisture pockets, knots, voids, and metal connectors. In particular, identifying moisture pockets is of high interest as moisture is associated with, or a precursor of, decay.\nDescription\nGPR evaluates the condition of wood members by emitting short pulses of electromagnetic (EM) waves into the members and capturing part of the EM waves reflected from the interface of materials with different dielectric constants. The transmitter and receiver are typically placed in the same box, which enables the single-sided inspection of members.(1)\nPhysical Principle\nAs EM waves interact with materials of different dielectric constants, part of the waves is reflected toward the surface. The amplitude of reflection is affected by the extent of the differences between the dielectric constant of medium components. For example, because the dielectric constant of metals is considered infinite, the reflected EM signal off the metal surface is quite strong. Therefore, metallic components (such as bolts) can be easily observed in the GPR scans of wood members. Furthermore, EM waves lose their energy as they travel into a material. The extent of the energy loss depends on the frequency of EM waves and the nature of the material. For example, because water tends to substantially attenuate the EM waves, the penetration depth of EM waves in wet wood is limited.\nData Acquisition\nUnlike common nondestructive evaluation (NDE) techniques, GPR does not require measurements at multiple points, but rather it provides a continuous image from the internal structure of wood members. For GPR inspection, the equipment can be moved over the surface to quickly scan the area of interest.(1) While metallic bolts tend to generate strong reflections with hyperbolic shapes, a major challenge with GPR inspections is the difficulty in differentiating between different features as in figure 1.(2,1)\n\u00a9 2021 Rodrigues, B. P., C. A. Senalik, X. Wu, and J. Wacker.\nFigure 1. Graphic. A sample of GPR scan with various types of features: One and two are knots, and three is a drilled hole (to simulate void).(1)\nFor inspecting timber members, high-frequency GPR (1.5\u20132.5 GHz) is commonly used, although depending on the special application, a lower frequency GPR (i.e., 900 MHz to 1 GHz) may also be used. While a higher frequency antenna provides a higher resolution of GPR scans, the depth of penetration decreases with increasing frequency. For example, in a moist wood where EM waves tend to substantially attenuate, a lower frequency antenna is preferred.(2)\nThe depth of GPR penetration can be estimated by placing a metal plate, which acts as a strong reflector, on the far side of the member if both sides of a member are accessible.(2) The known distance of the metal plate from the antenna can also help estimate the depth of other features (i.e., voids) in GPR images. The application of GPR for condition assessment of wood members is still largely limited to the lab environment; however, some studies have applied GPR for inspection of wood in the field environment.(1)\nData Processing\nProcessing of GPR data is often accomplished using software provided by the GPR vendor. When parabolic shapes are present in the scans (i.e., as in figure 1), postprocessing can be performed to assess the velocity of EM waves in a timber member. This postprocessing enables estimating the depth of features such as voids, bolts, and so on. Alternatively, the data gathered from placing a metal plate at the other side of the member (known distance from antenna) can be used to estimate the velocity of EM waves inside the member. The raw GPR output is a time-history signal, and it does not provide information about the depth of penetration.\nPostprocessing can also provide information about the amplitude of the signal at a certain depth and time. The postprocessing software allows exporting the amplitude of the GPR signal at multiple locations to a comma-separated value and text file.\nData Interpretation\nThe interpretation of data often requires GPR expertise. When the desired information is obtained from postprocessing, it may be plotted in the form of contour maps. Depending on the application, raw GPR signals can also be shown where features are marked (i.e., figure 1).\nAdvantages\nGPR has several advantages, including:\nRapid continuous member scanning.(2)\nOne-sided access.(2)\nRepeatable results.(2)\nScanning of imperfect surfaces.(2)\nIdentifying subsurface features, such as moisture pockets, knots, voids, and metal connectors.\nLimitations\nPostprocessing and interpretation of data can become complicated and may require NDE expertise.\nDifferentiating between the different subsurface features can be difficult.\nDetecting small defects (i.e., fine cracks) is challenging.(2)\nReferences\nRodrigues, B.

However, the method cannot directly measure the degree of corrosion.\nDescription\nHCP measurement is based on the coexistence of corroding areas (or anodic half-cells) and non-corroding areas (or cathodic half-cells) on rebar. The measurement is calculated as the potential differences, or voltages, across the steel-concrete interfaces. The potential difference between a standard portable half-cell, typically a Cu/CuSO4 electrode, and the reinforcing steel of a concrete element is measured.(1) When the reference electrode is moved along a line or grid on the surface of a member (figure 1), the spatial distribution of corrosion potential can be mapped. Any change in the potential between the reference electrode and the steel-concrete interface can be attributed to, among other things, the corrosion activity at the surface of the steel.\nFigure 1. Photo. HCP Measurements on a Concrete Deck Using a Rolling Probe.(2)\nThe HCP measurement is a well-established and widely used electrochemical technique to evaluate active corrosion in steel reinforced and pre-stressed concrete structures.(3) HCP measurements should be taken on a clean concrete surface since presence of isolating layers (asphalt, coating, and paint) may make measurements erroneous or impossible. Using empirical comparisons, the HCP\u2019s results can be linked to the probability of active corrosion.\nPhysical Principle \nFigure 2 depicts the principle of the HCP method. Corrosion of steel in concrete is similar to the electrochemical mechanism of corrosion of a metal in an electrolyte. This implies that separate anodic and cathodic processes take place simultaneously on the same metal surface. At the corroding side (the anode), iron is dissolved and oxidized to iron ions, leaving electrons in the steel. At the cathodic side of the reaction, oxygen is reduced and hydroxyl ions are produced. The potential of the generated electrical field is measured by a reference electrode. The reference electrode is connected to the positive end of a voltmeter and steel reinforcement to the negative one. The reference electrode is usually galvanically coupled to the concrete surface using a wet sponge. The input impedance of the voltmeter should be in the range of 106\u03a9 to 109\u03a9.\nFigure 2. Illustration. Principle of HCP Measurement.(3)\nData Acquisition\nASTM C876\u201309, Standard Test Method for Half-Cell Potentials of Uncoated Reinforcing Steel in Concrete, describes the HCP test method. The test procedure on a bridge deck can be summarized in the following steps:(4)\nLay out a 2ft by 2ft grid on the deck.\nLocate the top reinforcing bar using a rebar locator (GPR or pachometer) at several points along the bridge deck. A minimum of two locations is required for every test area so that continuity of the reinforcement can be checked. However, the actual number of locations depends on the size of the bridge and the continuity of the reinforcement.\nDrill or core a 1 inch hole in the concrete to expose the reinforcement at each location where reinforcement has been located (figure 3).\nFigure 3. Photo. Drilling a Hole into the Concrete over a Shallow Bar.(2)\nSecurely connect a lead wire to the reinforcement (figure 4).\nFigure 4. Photo. Lead Wire Connected to the Reinforcement by an Electrical Clip.(2)\nCheck electrical continuity of the steel reinforcement cage between the installed lead wire locations (taps) by connecting the two taps to a standard multimeter and measuring the resistance. The reinforcement is considered continuous when the measured resistance is 1\u03a9 or less considering the resistance of the lead wire.\nSecurely connect the exposed steel to the reference electrode.\nConnect the reference electrode to the negative terminal and the steel reinforcement to the positive terminal of the high impedance voltmeter.\nWet the contact sponge of the half-cell with soapy water to ensure good electrical contact with the concrete deck.\nIf time and access allows, pre-wet the deck prior to testing.\nPlace the reference electrode (wheel/rod) on each test point.  Once the voltage has stabilized, the measurement can be made by moving the wheel along the grid (figure 5).\nFigure 5. Photo. The Reference Electrode (Wheel/rod) Placed on a Test Point.(2)\nThe voltage values are stored in the data acquisition system or recorded by hand depending on the system being used.\nOnce testing is complete, patch all tap locations with acceptable concrete materials (figure 6).\nFigure 6. Photo. Patching Test Holes.(2)\nThe ionic solution in the reference electrode must be replaced periodically according to the manufacturer recommendations.\nData Processing \nNo processing of HCP data is typically performed. Discrepancies in measurement accuracy may exist when there are extreme variations in the cover depth, and HCP measurements may need to be adjusted based on measuring deck electrical resistivity obtained at the same HCP test locations. However, in practice, data are generally gridded and mapped using contour-mapping software based on the measured HCP data.\nData Interpretation \nGenerally, x- and y-coordinates are plotted against measured voltage to produce a map showing areas of very high likelihood for active corrosion, very low likelihood for active corrosion, or a transition zone that spans the measurements in between. According to ASTM C876\u201309, Standard Test Method for Half-Cell Potentials of Uncoated Reinforcing Steel in Concrete, a measured potential more negative than -350mV corresponds to a 90 percent probability of active corrosion.(4) A measured potential less negative than -200mV corresponds to a 90 percent probability of no active corrosion. Corrosion activity is uncertain if the potential is in the range of -350mV to -200mV (figure 7). HCP data are typically used with other physical or chemical sampling or other NDE methods. These methods can be used jointly to determine the corrosion state that exists within a bridge deck. Many researchers have shown a good correlation between GPR and HCP maps or other more direct measures of a corrosive environment or active corrosion. It is important to understand that these values are not absolute and depend on the material and environmental conditions of the measured reinforced concrete element.\nFigure 7. Contour Map.

The technique is generally sensitive to defects at the severe stage .\nDescription\nHammer sounding, commonly used for inspecting wood structures, involves tapping the wood surface with an object, such as a hammer, and listening to the echo. Damaged areas typically have a hollow or dull sound, and their echo is different from those in the surrounding regions. Hammer sounding is more appropriate for inspecting small regions. For example, as soon as visual inspection identifies suspected areas of damage, hammer sounding can be used to further investigate the region.\nPhysical Principle\nHammer sounding is a vibration-based technique in which a hammer is used as an excitation source, and the inspector\u2019s ears act as receivers. When an intact wood member is excited, its vibration frequency is related to its thickness and the velocity of sound in the member. For members with internal defects close to the surface, the vibration frequency is mainly affected by the vibration of the layer above the defects. Differences in the sound patterns caused by the vibration frequency of intact versus defective members enable an inspector to identify the defective regions.\nData Acquisition\nFor inspecting wood structures, a pick hammer, commonly used by geologists, is recommended.(1) The hammer allows for both sounding using the flat end and probing using the pick end. Hammer sounding is typically best used on side-grain, while pick probing can be used effectively at side- and end-grain locations. Once sounding detects potentially damaged or decayed areas, advanced inspection techniques, such as stress wave timing and resistance microdrilling, can be used for further investigations.\nSource: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service.\nFigure 1. Photos. A pick hammer is used for sounding and probing wood members.(1)\nData Processing\nNo data processing is required\nData Interpretation\nAreas with hollow or dull sounds are marked on the wood structure as defective regions.\nAdvantages\nHammer sounding includes the following advantages:\nWell-established field inspection technique.\nQuick and simple.\nLow cost.\nLimitations\nSome limitations of hammer sounding include the following:\nMay fail to detect early or intermediate stages of decay.(2)\nCan be subjective.\nDoes not provide quantitative information about the physical and mechanical properties of wood members.\nReferences\nWhite, R.

Figure 1 shows an example of conducting vision-based bridge inspection for the Ticonic Bridge in Maine. The high-resolution digital photography can also be used for other engineering applications, including land surveying and emergency management of flooding.(1) This web page primarily focuses on using high\u2011resolution digital photography for surface crack detection.\n\u00a9 2020 VHB.\u00ae\nFigure 1. Photo. Image captured during bridge inspection showing visible cracks and concrete spalls.(2) \nDescription\nHigh-resolution digital photography refers to the capture of digital images with a large number of pixels, resulting in a high level of visual details. This capture is typically achieved by using high\u2011definition (HD) digital cameras with advanced image sensors and lenses technology. Now high-resolution digital photography for vision-based bridge inspections mainly uses unmanned aerial systems (UAS) equipped with HD digital cameras. Because UAS has the capability of collecting HD image data in challenging environments with limited traffic control, HD imaging through UAS can improve efficiency, enhance safety, and lower the economic costs of bridge inspections compared to manual visual inspections by inspectors. The collected HD image data can support inspection reports, develop 3D-digital model reconstruction, and diagnose surface defects (e.g., cracks).\nThe creation of a 3D-digital model provides bridge owners with many advantages, including creating a structural visualization in the absence of original drawings, supplementing essential information for numerical modeling, which can be used alone or in combination with other inspection data, and providing a data archive for postinspection review. Surface defect mapping provides useful information about the location and severity of surface defects across structural surfaces. The mapping results can be used as evidence for executing additional indepth analysis or inspection. For more information about the use of UAS to support bridge inspections, refer to a Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) report and TechBriefs. (See references 2\u20135.)\nPhysical Principle \nDigital cameras capture images through an optical system that uses a lens with a variable diagram to focus light onto an electronic image-pickup device. Because surface defects (e.g., cracks) present different visual appearances than surrounding areas, surface defects are likely identifiable through visual examination or image analysis.\nData Acquisition \nData acquisition involves collecting image data from digital cameras. Various features of the camera and its operations may influence the quality of the images. Based on laboratory results from an FHWA-sponsored research project, the following sensor specification and operational practices for using UAS digital cameras are recommended:(4)\nSensor resolution should be at least 12 megapixels.\nAutomatic sensor setting is sufficient.\nMaintain a minimum standoff distance of 5 ft.\nOptical zoom capability is a plus but not necessary.\nAugmented lighting can improve image quality in low-light conditions.\nData Processing\nCrack detection can be manually implemented through visual examination, which is labor intensive and inefficient. Automatic crack detection is achievable through image processing techniques. Sobel and Canny edge detectors are examples of two edge detection algorithms available.(5,6) With recent advancements in machine learning and the availability of large-scale training image databases, using deep-learning algorithms for crack detection is more efficient and accurate, and thus, deep learning has become popular and dominant in recent years. The convolutional neural network is the primary deep-learning model that yields high accuracy for crack detection.(7) For more information about using deep learning for crack detection, see an early work by a group of researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Canada, and a recent report from an FHWA-sponsored research project.(8)\nData Interpretation \nCrack detection results are usually visually intuitive. All visible cracks should be properly noted in bridge inspections.(9,10)\nAdvantages \nIdentify surface defects through visual examination.\nAchieve limited traffic control with UAS.\nHold potential for automatic crack detection with advanced image processing algorithms.\nEnable data storage for further use (e.g., 3D-digital model reconstruction and postinspection review).\nLimitations \nManual visual examination can be subject to performance fatigue of inspectors.\nSpecial specifications are required for the camera and its operation.\nModerate to significant expertise and training are required for developing automatic crack detection.\nReferences \nFHWA. n.d. \u201cUnmanned Ariel Systems\u201d (web page). https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/uas/library.cfm, last accessed February 22, 2024.\nNeubauer, K., E.

        "text": "NDE\nBridge\nImpact Echo (IE)\nTechnology\nImpact Echo (IE)\nExport PDF\nTarget of Investigation\nPrimary applications of IE include the following:\nDetecting and characterizing delamination on reinforced concrete elements.\nCharacterization of grouting in tendon ducts.\nDebonding detection on decks with overlays.\nMeasuring the thickness of slabs and walls.\nIE has also been used with limited success in the following applications:\nEvaluating the depth and primary direction of surface opening cracks (vertical cracks in bridge decks).\nDetecting ducts and voids in ducts, as long as the diameter to concrete cover ratio is above a certain threshold, roughly one third. While horizontal position can be well-defined, it is difficult to accurately define the concrete cover thickness. Detection of ducts requires a scanning approach and in most case requires a higher level expertise.\nDescription\nThe IE method is a seismic or stress-wave based method used to detect defects in concrete, primarily delamination. The objective of the IE survey is to detect and characterize wave reflectors or \u201cresonators\u201d in a concrete bridge deck or other structural elements. IE devices can have multiple IE probes (figure 1) or a single IE probe (figure 2), each consisting of an impactor and a sensor.\nFigure 1. Photo. Automated IE Equipment.(1)\nFigure 2. Photo. Manual IE Testing Using a Single IE Probe and a Close Up of the Probe.\nPhysical Principle \nThe impact echo (IE) test is conducted using an impact source and a nearby receiver. The impact generates waves that propagate within the solid material. Waves are reflected by internal defects (difference in acoustic impedance) or external boundaries. When the reflected waves, or echoes, return to the surface, they produce displacements. The transient response time of the solid structure is measured with a sensor mounted on the surface close to the impact source. The multiple reflected waves monitored by the sensor manifest as resonance conditions in the frequency domain analyses.\nData Acquisition\nFor a complete data collection procedure, refer to ASTM C1383, Test Method for Measurement P-Wave Speed and the Thickness of Concrete Plates Using the Impact-Echo Method.(2)\nThe deck surface to be surveyed needs to be cleaned of debris before IE testing. The survey should be conducted on the densest grid possible (a 2-ft by 2-ft grid is recommended). Mark the grid using a washable paint or chalk. Data collection can conducted using a variety of devices, each providing a different level of accuracy, speed, and automation.\nThe equipment used for IE testing consists of an impactor (figure 3) and a sensor recording the response of the deck or other structure.(2) The impactor should be selected carefully to provide enough energy in the frequency range of interest. Some impactors are equipped with a sensor to measure the characteristics of the impact. The following are the wavelength frequency requirements:\nIt should be shorter that the lateral size of the defect.\nIt should be shorter than twice the depth of the defect to be detected.\nA simple rule used in the definition of the maximum useful frequency is the inverse of the impact duration (contact time), which is typically from 20 to 100 \u00b5s. Many IE systems utilize steel balls of different sizes as impact sources, where the center and maximum frequencies are inversely proportional to the ball diameter. \nFigure 3. Photo. Close Up of Manual IE Testing on a Bridge Deck.(1)\nData Processing \nThe amplitude spectrum obtained from the fast Fourier transform analysis of the time signal will show dominant peaks at certain frequencies, which can be interpreted to assess the deck condition. Energy partitioning of elastic waves may vary depending on the extent and continuity of the delamination. Different subjective grades can be assigned to a particular section of a deck as a part of the condition assessment process.\nThe thickness mode normally dominates the spectral response of a plate-like structure that does not contain any near-surface defects.(3) The frequency of the fundamental thickness mode can be related to the thickness of the deck (figure 4).\nFigure 4. Equation. Deck Thickness.(3)\nWhere:\n\u03b2 = Correction factor.\nCp = Compression-wave velocity of concrete.\nfIE = IE frequency.\nThe spectra shown in figure 5 are examples of IE results for different severity levels of delamination. They correspond to the tested areas above them. In the case of a sound deck (good condition), a distinctive peak in the response spectrum corresponding to the full depth of the deck can be observed. An initial or incipient delamination (fair condition) is identified through the presence of two distinct peaks, indicating energy partitioning from two dominant wave propagation patterns, the first peak corresponding to reflections from the bottom of the deck and the second one to reflections from the delamination. Progressed delamination (poor condition) is characterized by a single peak at a frequency corresponding to a reflector depth that is shallower than the deck thickness, indicating that little or no energy is being propagated towards the bottom of the deck. Finally, in the very severe case of a wide or shallow delamination (serious condition), the dominant response of the deck to an impact is characterized by the low-frequency response of flexural mode oscillations of the upper delaminated portion of the element. This response is almost always in the audible frequency range.\nFigure 5. Illustration. Physical Principle of IE.(4)\nData Interpretation \nIE results are presented in various forms, some describing the position of reflectors, some interpreting the condition with respect to the state of delamination.(1) Some of the approaches are presented below.\nFigure 6 presents the dominant reflectors, or resonators, in terms of the spectral surface. The colors refer to different dominant frequencies identified in the response spectrum. Blue colors, between 8 and 10 kHz, refer to the bottom of the deck, meaning no defect. Red colors correspond to flexural oscillations of shallow delaminations.\nFigure 6. Contour Map. IE Data Presented as Frequency Spectral Surface.(5)\nThe results are often described in terms of different condition grades related to the state of progression of delamination development (figure 7). For example, the fair and poor grades refer to incipient or progressed delamination, and the serious grade corresponds to either shallow or wide delamination. \nFigure 7. Contour Map. Condition Assessment with Respect to Delamination Progression.(1)\nAdvantages \nCan detect delamination at very early stages.\nCan detect debonding of layers, like concrete type overlays.\nFast data analysis with respect to delamination characterization.\nUnambiguous data interpretation.\nTesting insensitive to traffic induced vibrations.\nReliable and repeatable when conducted properly by an experienced operator.\nLimitations  \nModerate to significant expertise and training required for equipment setup and data collection, processing, and interpretation.\nSlow data collection using traditional single probe equipment; requires lane closure.\nRequires a dense test grid to accurately define the boundaries of delaminated areas, adding to the test duration.\nMore complicated to evaluate the condition of overlaid bridge decks; cannot assess the condition of the deck in areas where the overlay is debonded.\nGeometrical and boundary effects should be taken into consideration, especially for structural elements, like girders, piers, and pier caps.\nReferences \nStrategic Highway Research Program, \u201cSHRP2 NDToolbox,\u201d (Website), Washington, DC, Accessed online: February 2015, http://www.ndtoolbox.org/content/bridges.\nASTM, Standard Test Method for Measuring the P-Wave Speed and the Thickness of Concrete Plates Using the Impact-Echo Method, C1383-04(2010), ASTM International, West Conshohocken, PA, 2010.\nSansalone, M., and Carino, N., \u201cDetecting Delaminations in Concrete Slabs with and without Overlays Using the Impact-Echo Method,\u201d ACI Materials Journal, Vol. 86, No. 2, pp. 175\u2013184, 1989.\nGucunski, N., et. al., Nondestructive Testing to Identify Concrete Bridge Deck Deterioration, Report S2-Ro6A-RR-1, SHRP2 Renewal Research, Transportation Research Board, 2013.\nAzari, H., Yuan, D., Nazarian, S., and Gucunski, N., \u201cSonic Methods to Detect Delamination in Concrete Bridge Decks: Impact of Testing Configuration and Data Analysis Approach,\u201d Transportation Research Record (TRR): Journal of Transportation Research Board, No. 2292, Transportation Research Board of the National Academics, Washington, DC, pp. 113-124, 2012.\nLast updated on August 24, 2022",

It has been used to detect defects in transportation infrastructures since the 1980s. This primarily included detection of delamination, voids, and similar defects and anomalies. The detection of defects by IR thermography is based on measuring temperature variations on the surface of an element as a result of differences in thermal conductivity and specific heat capacity of materials and thermal conduction discontinuities within the element. Maps of surface temperature (thermograms) are generated from images taken by infrared cameras (figure 1) that measure the infrared radiation emitted by a body and converted into an electrical signal. The wavelengths of interest are between 0.7 and14 \u00b5m. In most cases, a qualitative data analysis is done even though a number of programs were developed to automatically detect and interpret different types of defects or anomalies.\nFigure 1. Photo. Infrared (IR) Thermography Used in the Field.\nPhysical Principle \nIR thermography is based on detecting and measuring radiation in the wavelength range of 0.7 to 14 \u00b5m of the electromagnetic spectrum. Thermal radiation (emissivity) of materials is controlled by three main properties that influence the heat flow and distribution within a material:  thermal conductivity, specific heat capacity, and mass density. Infrared cameras measure the thermal radiation emitted by a body to capture the regions with temperature differences. Figures 2 and 3 illustrate the physical principle of IR thermography in detecting defects in concrete decks. When solar or other natural radiation, as in the case of passive thermography, heats up the deck, the deck and all the objects in the deck emit some energy back, sometimes following different thermal paths (figure 2). Delamination, voids, and other anomalies, which in some cases may be filled with water, have different thermal conductivity and thermal capacity than the surrounding concrete. Therefore, the area on top of a delaminated area may heat up faster after the sunrise and cool down more quickly during and after the sunset compared to sound concrete. As a result, those areas may develop surface temperatures up to several degrees centigrade higher than the surrounding sound concrete areas when ambient conditions are favorable.(2) In the case of active thermography, the surface of the object is heated by a heater to create thermal contrasts between the defects of interest and the element (figure 3). \nFigure 2. Illustration. Heat Cycle of a Deck After Sunset (left) and After Sunrise (right).(2)\nFigure 3. Illustration. Active Infrared Thermography, with the Surface Heated by a Heater and the Thermal Radiation Captured by an Infrared Camera.\nData Acquisition\nDepending on the heating source, infrared thermography surveys are described as passive or active. Passive IR thermography is more commonly used since it is uses natural heating sources. In most cases, the sun is the heating source and, thus, structures directly exposed to sun heating (for example, bridge decks) are good candidates for passive IR thermography. The best time for an IR survey is between 5 and 9 hours after sunrise or at about the same number of hours after sunset. Experiments have shown the highest temperature contrasts are achieved during those periods. Other environmental factors can affect the effectiveness of an IR thermography survey, like cloudiness or precipitation.(3) The survey is conducted using IR cameras (figure 4). Modern cameras simultaneously take IR and high resolution video images. The color coded IR images, called thermograms, represent temperature gradients. Those are evaluated for cold or hot spots, which in many cases represent and are interpreted as defects or anomalies. On the other hand, active or impulse-thermography utilizes radiant and fan heaters, or flash or halogen lamps, thus eliminating dependence on the heat from sun or other natural heating source. While active thermography may produce better controlled and higher quality results, it is used only in evaluations of smaller elements.\nFor complete data collection procedures, refer to ASTM D 4788-03 (2013), Standard Test Method for Detecting Delaminations in Bridge Decks Using Infrared Thermography.(4)\nFigure 4.

As illustrated in figure 5, superimposing the thermograph on the video image can help interpret the deck condition by correlating the visible damage, such as spalling on the surface, to thermal anomalies. For example, high temperature areas in figure 5 indicate presence of inhomogeneities; for a bridge deck, this likely means delamination.

The corrosion rates can be used to predict the remaining service life of a tested structure. However, as the test results only indicate the instantaneous rates of steel bar corrosion, using the obtained corrosion rates for such purpose is limited and still of controversy.\nDescription\nWhen the passive oxide film that protects the steel is broken by an unfavorable environment in the concrete, the potential difference produces a current within a micro electrolytic cell. At the anode of this cell, iron atoms transform to ferrous ions, move into the surrounding concrete, and leave their free electrons on the steel bar. When the corrosion continues, these free electrons accumulate and give the rebar negative charge. The HCP method, based on detecting these negative charges, finds regions with likely corrosion activities, and the LPR technique helps identify the rate of rebar corrosion. Figure 1 shows the LPR method.\nFigure 1. Photo. LPR Testing Setup.\nPhysical Principle \nThe LPR technique is a method for evaluating instantaneous rate of rebar corrosion.(1) The technique is noninvasive but requires a localized damage to the concrete cover to enable an electrical connection to be made to the reinforcing steel. The principal of LPR is based on disturbing the corrosion equilibrium on the surface of steel reinforcing bars by introducing a small perturbative electrical signal using a surface counter electrode (figure 2). Monitoring the relationship between electrochemical potential and current generated between electrically charged electrodes under the test allows the calculation of the corrosion rate. The data provides the instantaneous rate of the steel reinforcement corrosion at the test location, giving more detailed information than a simple HCP measurement.\nThe term \u201cpolarization\u201d refers to the change in the open-circuit potential as a result of the passage of current produced by the auxiliary electrode. For a small perturbation of the open circuit potential, there is a linear relationship between the change in voltage and the change in applied current per unit area of electrodes, and this ratio is called the polarization resistance.\nThe LPR technique may be used for accurate measurement of corrosion rates. It is very sensitive, so very low rates can be identified. Used with HCP, the technique provides complete knowledge about the state of corrosion activity.\nFigure 2. Illustration. Linear Polarization Resistance Measurement\nData Acquisition\nThe first step in the LPR data collection is to expose the steel reinforcement and makepositive electrical contact (tap). After confirming the continuity of the electrical conductivity between the contact point and reinforcement in the concrete area being tested, the LRP test can be performed using either manual or automated methods.\nFor the manual method, readings are collected using a three-electrode polarization resistance (3LP) system, and the reinforcement is polarized through manual operations. First, the electrical potential is monitored until it is stable, with potential variations of no more than +/- 5 mV per minute. If readings are not stable, it may indicate inadequate moisture or interference by an external electrical source, which should be evaluated and rectified before proceeding. Once a stable potential is established, the electrical potential value  is recorded. The system is set to report a relative potential, versus the open-circuit potential, and the meter is zeroed. Electrical current is then applied to polarize the reinforcement at a slow, steady rate, such that the offset potential reaches +4, +8, and +12 mV from the open-circuit potential. At each noted potential increment, the corresponding current required to achieve that offset is recorded. The complete polarization procedure should take no longer than 2 minutes. Once complete, the current is removed, and the reinforcement is allowed to de-polarize. Within 3 minutes, the potential should return to the open-circuit potential. If it does not, then the associated \u201cdrift\u201d in open-circuit potential will influence the measured corrosion rate, so the measurement should be re-taken. A period of 5 to 10 minutes should pass before repeating readings to ensure adequate de-polarization.\nSome field instruments and laboratory potentiostats can be programmed (or are pre-programmed) to perform the polarization process automatically. Such systems should be programmed to linearly perturb the potential to at least +12 mV and no more than +20 mV from open-circuit potential at a rate of 10 mV per minute. It is preferred that the system monitors and collects the open-circuit potential, recording potentials in 1 second intervals for at least 1 minute before and after the test. Some devices are equipped with a \u201cguard ring\u201d electrode that induces a separate current into the electrode that surrounds and attempts to \u201ccontain\u201d the primary counter electrode current into a specified polarization area. Such instruments are known to give significantly different corrosion rate values than the methods outlined above and are believed to underestimate the actual corrosion rate.\nData Processing \nData processing of LPR test involves three main steps:\nStep 1: Calculate the area (A) of the rebar affected (perturbed) by the measurement.\nStep 2: Calculate polarization resistance (Rp) by dividing the measured potential (resulted from current change) by small current step (used as the perturbative signal).\nStep 3: Calculate the corrosion rate (icorr) as shown in figure 3.\nFigure 3.

MFL is also commonly used to test the cables of suspension or cable stayed bridges. MFL units can be clamped onto a cable as part of a climbing module or rolled across a surface.\nDescription\nThe MFL method uses a magnetic field to detect flaws in ferromagnetic materials such as steel in bridge components like prestressed girders, post-tensioned girders and decks, and suspension cables. The technique involves using an electromagnet or a permanent magnet yoke to magnetize the object being tested. The injected magnetic fluxes flow through the ferromagnetic object because it has a higher permeability than air. Any defect or discontinuity in the test object causes leakage of magnetic fluxes from the object, detectable by magnetic field sensors. It is very similar to magnetic particle testing, however instead of using magnetic particles to create a visual indication on the surface, MFL uses sensors and data processing to provide real-time results during inspections.\nPhysical Principle \nMFL equipment magnetizes embedded reinforcement bar (like steel, prestressed element/strand, post-tensioned tendon, etc.) inside a concrete structure along its length via an external magnet. The potential leakage of the magnetic field from the magnetized reinforcement is evaluated by one or more magnetic sensors within the MFL equipment.(1) The output of the sensors is normally recorded in the form of the magnetic signal amplitude as a function of the position along the length of the reinforcement being tested (figure 1). Without flaws present, the internal magnetic flux lines are uniform and travel through the material. Any change in the magnetic field within reinforcement can be linked to the extent of section loss from corrosion or fracture in the reinforcement.\nFigure 1. Illustration. Magnetic Flux Leakage.\nData Acquisition\nOnly a limited number of private service entities possess the required equipment to perform MFL tests on concrete girders or decks. One or more magnetic sensors are used in the MFL equipment. MFL equipment may be operated manually by moving the equipment on the top of a bridge deck or close to the concrete surface and along the length of the prestressing strands or post-tensioning tendon located inside the concrete. It is also possible to use a robotic mechanism to perform the MFL testing with little to no interruption of traffic flowing under bridge girders (figure 1). For MFL testing on the underside of prestressed adjacent box girders, platforms are necessary for operating the equipment.(1)\nFigure 2. Photo. Use of the MFL Equipment on Prestressed Concrete I-Girders.\nData Processing \nPostprocessing of the MFL data is required when detecting small section losses, e.g., less than approximately 10 percent or when there are interfering materials and elements near the prestressing strands or post-tensioning tendons inside concrete. Such postprocessing approaches include comparative and correlation analyses based on existing results from known laboratory and field conditions.\nData Interpretation \nThe operator monitors the magnetic field amplitude as a function of the test position on a computer screen in real time to identify changes in the magnetic field. In the absence of interfering ferromagnetic materials in the surrounding areas of prestressing strands or post-tensioning tendons, a real-time visual examination of the MFL data or graphs can offer sufficient knowledge about the lack or presence of corrosion or fracture in the strands. Any changes in the magnetic field can be directly related to section loss in the prestressing strands or in the post-tensioning tendons due to corrosion or fracture.(2) When there are interfering ferromagnetic materials near the prestressing strands or post-tensioning tendons, more advanced analysis and interpretation of the MFL signal are necessary. Figure 2 shows a MFL graph for a prestressing strand in an in-service bridge that includes a strand fracture as well as transverse steel bars (stirrups).\nFigure 3. Composite Graph.

        "text": "NDE\nBridge\nMagnetic Particle Testing (MT)\nTechnology\nMagnetic Particle Testing (MT)\nExport PDF\nTarget of Investigation\nMT is commonly applied for crack detection in steel girders, steel truss members, and ancillary steel structures such as sign supports and light poles. The method may be applied during the fabrication process to ensure the quality of welds or may be applied to in-service structures for the detection of cracks developed from service loads. \nDescription\nMT is a method of locating surface and subsurface discontinuities in ferromagnetic materials. When the material or part being tested is magnetized, magnetic discontinuities that lie in a direction transverse to the direction of the magnetic field, a leakage field is formed at and above the surface of the part. The presence of this leakage field, and therefore the presence of the discontinuity, is detected by using finely divided ferromagnetic particles applied over the surface, with some of the particles being gathered and held by the leakage field. This magnetically held collection of particles forms an outline of the discontinuity and indicates its location, size, shape, and extent. Magnetic particles are applied over a surface as dry particles or as wet particles in a liquid carrier such as water or oil.\nPhysical Principle \nMT works on the physical principles of magnetic induction and magnetic field leakage. This method can only be applied to ferromagnetic materials, such as steel. When a specimen is subjected to a magnetic field, the presence of a defect will cause local distortions in the magnetic field around the defect area. This effect is referred to as magnetic flux leakage. If fine particles of magnetic material are placed on the specimen in the presence of the magnet field, they will become oriented in alignment with the magnetic flux lines and the disruption of those lines caused by a defect.\nFigure 1. Illustration. Magnetic Particle Basic Principle.\nData Acquisition\nMT is typically applied using a \u201cdry powder\u201d method for crack detection in steel bridge components. Magnetic particles infused with a colored dye are broadcast onto the surface of the material under test. A blower may be used to remove excess powder from the surface; particles not confined by a magnetic field are removed, particles confined by magnetic forces remain forming the indication.\nSurface preparation for applying MT includes removing coatings to ensure effective coupling of the magnetic field into the material under test. Removing the coating also reduces the likelihood of nonrelevant indications forming from debris on the surface or imperfections in the coating itself. Debris or imperfections in the coating can mechanically confine the particles resulting in a nonrelevant indication. Care must be taken to ensure crack openings are not obscured during coating removal using mechanical removal processes (e.g., grinding). \nThe orientation of the magnetic fields induced in the material must be orthogonal to a crack opening to ensure sufficient leakage field to capture magnetic particles. Direct magnetization using prods develops circular magnetic fields around each prod. Consequently, the orientation of a crack must lie parallel to an imaginary line connecting the prods. In contrast, indirect magnetization results in a magnetic field in the material that is parallel to an imaginary line connecting the yokes. Therefore, the crack must be oriented orthogonal to an imaginary line connecting the yokes. When the orientation of cracks is not known, procedures for MT typically require reorientation of the yokes or prods in orthogonal positions to ensure cracks are detected reliably.(1) \nData Processing \nCrack indications are detected by visual inspection; therefore, no processing of data is required.\nData Interpretation \nThe primary data acquired from MT are indications on the surface of the material created from accumulated magnetic particles. These indications are interpreted by an inspector to determine if the source of the indication is a crack or if the indication is caused by a non-crack geometric feature, contamination on the surface of the material, or some other nonrelevant source. Relevant indications (i.e., crack indications) are documented by the inspector through notes, photographs, and/or diagrams.\nFigure 2 shows typical MT crack indications in a weld that connects a vertical stiffener to a girder web.\nFigure 2.

        "text": "NDE\nBridge\nMagnetometer (MM)\nTechnology\nMagnetometer (MM)\nExport PDF\nTarget of Investigation\nMagnetometer is an instrument mainly used to detect rebar size, rebar orientation, rebar location, rebar depth (concrete cover depth). Magnetometer is also commonly used to obtain as-built information on embedded rebar when there are no record drawings available. Though magnetometers cannot detect corrosion directly, their ability to measure cover is helpful; lower cover increases the ability for concrete to deteriorate and expose steel to oxygen and moisture.\nDescription\nThe first magnetometers, known as \u201ccovermeters,\u201d \u201cprofometer,\u201d or \u201cpachometers,\u201d were manufactured in the 1950s. Prior to the mid-1980s, magnetometers were built based on the magnetic reluctance principle.(1) More recent devices have been manufactured according to the concept of electrical conductivity to offer better system stability for detecting ferrous and nonferrous metals inside concrete.\nMagnetometer is commonly used in conjunction with other NDE technologies. For example, for tests requiring a concrete core sample or contact with embedded steel reinforcement through drilling a hole, a magnetometer can help the drill miss any reinforcement. Additionally, a magnetometer can quickly and easily handle construction inspection quality control for recently-constructed bridges if, for example, there is a question about adequate cover (e.g., determining if a rebar cage floated up during the concrete pour).\nPhysical Principle \nMagnetometers are based on an electromagnetic field and are unaffected by nonconductive materials such as concrete, composite, and timber. The eddy current principal charges a primary coil, creating a magnetic field. Eddy currents are produced on the surface of any electrically conductive material in the vicinity of the magnetic field. The eddy currents induce a magnetic field in the opposite direction of the primary coil field. This opposition affects the measured impedance in the coil. Reinforcing bars that are closer to the probe or are larger produce a stronger magnetic field. They operate at frequencies above 1 kHz. The magnetic induction principle is similar to that of a transformer. Primary coils are charged while a secondary set of coils pick up the voltage transferred by the magnetic circuit created by the primary coils and rebar. Magnetometers based on magnetic induction are less sensitive than ones using eddy current principles. Regardless of the principle used, the size, orientation, and location of the rebar (concrete cover) affect voltage measurement, in terms of amplitude and phase difference.(1,2) Magnetometers using induction operate at frequencies below 90 Hz.\nWhen an electrically conductive material, e.g., steel rebar inside concrete, is subjected to a changing magnetic field, eddy currents are generated along the material\u2019s surface. The eddy currents induce a magnetic field in an opposite direction of the initially introduced magnetic field that causes a voltage change in one or more coils or sensors inside the probe. The voltage change is a function of the rebar size, location, and orientation. The voltage change, in terms of amplitude and phase difference, is measured and analyzed to estimate rebar size, location (concrete cover), and orientation. \nData Acquisition\nA magnetometer consists of a magnetic probe and a data processor with a display screen. In some equipment, the probe, data processor, and display screen are integrated into a single lightweight, hand-held device. The probe is moved along the surface of a concrete deck or girder. As the operator moves the probe, he/she can observe magnetic field changes on the screen in either a digital or graphical form. Rebar orientation can be determined through a planar rotation of the probe at the concrete surface. The longitudinal axis of the probe is aligned with the direction of the rebar when a maximum value of the magnetic field is indicated on the screen of the magnetometer. \nMapping rebar in concrete decks may be accomplished by scanning the concrete surface with the probe in different directions (figure 1). The operator marks the concrete surface when the location and orientation of each rebar are determined.(3) Some commercially available equipment has the capability to map rebar in concrete decks and display a rebar grid on the screen. The data may be recorded and saved for post-processing and documentation.\nFigure 1. Photo. Locating a Rebar with a Magnetometer (Profometer).\nData Processing \nAll data processing is performed internally by the data processor component of the equipment. As such, no significant data manipulation is required by the operator. The data processor is programmed to compare detected magnetic field changes with those from known rebar sizes at different depths inside concrete to make an estimate of the rebar size and location. \nData Interpretation \nMagnetometers are simple to operate, with minimal operator training required. However, experience is required to interpret the results in complex cases (e.g., dense rebar placement). To minimize the effect of the nearby ferromagnetic materials, the maximum depth of concrete cover should be limited to about two-thirds of the distance between two adjacent bars. When both the rebar size and concrete cover are unknown, the operator must assume a value for one (usually the rebar size) to estimate the other unknown parameter. \nAdvantages \nProvides rapid information about rebar size, orientation, or concrete cover.\nField-worthy equipment.\nEasy to operate equipment, with minimal operator training required.\nAudible output with available headset option for working in noisy environments.\nSome systems applicable to non-ferrous metals, e.g., stainless steel bars.\nRelatively inexpensive and commercially available equipment.\nLimitations  \nOnly effective within top 4 inches of the concrete surface. \nOnly first layer of reinforcing steel may be located and sized.\nDecreased effective depth as rebar spacing decreases.

        "text": "NDE\nBridge\nMoisture Content Measurement\nTechnology\nMoisture Content Measurement\nExport PDF\nTarget of investigations\nEstimating the moisture content of wood is important as the potential for wood decay increases for moisture contents greater than 20 percent, and serious decay can occur at moisture contents above 30 percent. High moisture levels can occur when wood is exposed to rain, groundwater, or moisture infiltration.(1) Fully saturated members do not develop fungi decay due to the lack of oxygen; however, since the water level of rivers or streams tend to change with time, timber piles are prone to fungal decay, especially at the water\u2019s surface (i.e., the mud zone).(1)\nDescription\nRather than directly measuring the wood moisture level, electrical moisture meters estimate the moisture level of wood by measuring the change in its electrical properties such as conductivity (inverse of resistivity), dielectric constant, or power loss factor due to absorbing moisture.(2)\nPhysical Principle\nThe electrical properties of wood can change by approximately 10 orders of magnitude as its possible moisture content changes. Such a high sensitivity to the presence of moisture has led to the common application of electrical-based techniques for the accurate prediction of the wood moisture content.(2) The electrical-based techniques commonly estimate the conductivity of wood members using direct current (DC) and typically measure the dielectric properties of wood with an alternating current (AC).\nConductivity\nThe relationship between the applied DC voltage (V) and measured current (I) at the two ends of a conducting member with length L, and cross-section area A is as follows:\nFigure 1. Equation. The conductivity equation.\nWhere \u03c1 is resistivity, and it has a unit of \u03a9.m. Furthermore, conductivity (\u03c3) is equal to 1/\u03c1.(2)\nThe conductivity of wood is substantially affected by its moisture content. The conductivity of oven-dried wood is in the order of 10-16-10-15 S m,-1, while at fiber saturation, it is in the order of 10-4-10-3 S m-1. From fiber saturation level to a fully saturated wood, conductivity typically increases less than one hundred times.(2) For example, the conductivity of slash pine in the longitudinal direction for moisture content between 8 percent and 180 percent is shown in figure 2.\nSource: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service.\nFigure 2. Scatter plot. Conductivity versus moisture content of slash pine.(2)\nWood conductivity is also influenced by the fiber direction and temperature.(2) Conductivity tends to increase with temperature. Furthermore, conductivity is higher along fibers (grains) than across them, with slightly higher in the radial direction than tangential direction (figure 3). The ratio of electrical conductivity in the longitudinal, radial, and tangential directions is approximately 1.0:0.55:0.5.(2)\nSource: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service.\nFigure 3.

In the wood literature, it is common to refer to \u03b5'  as the dielectric constant.(2)\nBoth \u03b5'  and \u03b5\"  are frequency- and temperature-dependent. At 1 MHz, the \u03b5'  of dry wood is approximately 3, and that of wet wood is approximately 100. At each frequency, \u03b5\"  increases with moisture content and temperature. \u03b5'  is larger parallel to the grain than across the grain.(2)\nAnother parameter is the power factor (fp), which can be expressed as follows:\nFigure 5. Equation. The principle equation of the dielectric moisture meter.\nfp is a measure of the heat produced as a dielectric material is exposed to an electric field, and it is used in dielectric moisture meters to estimate the moisture content of wood. The power factor of wood varies from 0.01 for dry and low-density wood to 0.95 for wet and dense wood. The power factor is usually larger along the grain than across the grain. Similar to , fp is affected by frequency, moisture, and temperature.(2)\nData Acquisition\nThere are two main types of electrical moisture meters: conductance type and dielectric-based moisture meters. The conductance type electrodes measure the conductivity of direct current between the device\u2019s two electrodes. On the other hand, the dielectric-based moisture meters can measure either the dielectric constant or power loss factor. The ones that estimate the dielectric constant are referred to as capacitance or capacitive admittance meters, while the electrical moisture meters that measure the power loss factor are called power loss meters.(2)\nThe electrodes of conductance-type moisture meters (up to 3 inches long) can be driven into the timber to assess the electrical resistance between two pins (figure 6). These electrodes are either uninsulated or insulated, except for the tip of the electrodes. The uninsulated electrodes estimate the lowest resistance along their lengths, while insulated electrodes give the resistance at their tips. The 3 inch-long insulated electrodes (pin-style electrodes) are highly recommended for bridge applications and allow for determining moisture gradients along the penetration depth. Results from the conductance-type moisture meters need to be corrected for the temperature and type of species. Approximate correction for wood temperature involves adding 0.5 percent for each 10 \u2109 temperature lower than the device\u2019s calibration temperature and subtracting 0.5 percent for each 10 \u2109 temperature higher than the device\u2019s calibration temperature. Newer moisture meters include settings for automatic corrections based on the species and entered temperature.\nFurthermore, the type of preservatives can affect results. Since the resistance of a medium is affected by the presence of salts, the use of conductance-type moisture meters in estimating the moisture content of timber pressure treated with salt-based preservatives (i.e., alkaline copper quaternary and chromated copper arsenate can be unreliable.(3) In this case, drill cores can be used to determine moisture content via oven-dry methods (ASTM 4442(4) or ASTM D4444(5)).\nSource: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service.\nFigure 6. Photo. Conductance type (pin-style) moisture meter.(1)\nThe newer capacitance electrodes are mainly sensitive to the near-surface moisture of timber members, and they require specific gravity to estimate the moisture content.(2) The specific gravity can be provided by selecting the species type on the device. These moisture meters correct for the wood temperature internally. The reliable range of estimating moisture for the commercial conductance electrodes is 6 percent to 30 percent, and for capacitance moisture meters is 4 percent to 30 percent. Readings above 30 percent should be considered qualitative.(2)\nData Processing\nDepending on the temperature during testing, conductivity measured by the conductance-type electrodes may need correction for the temperature effects.\nData Interpretation\nThe moisture content of wood does not provide direct information about the presence of decay, but it suggests the potential for decay. Moisture contents above 20 percent indicate the potential for decay with significant decay at moisture contents above 30 percent. The presence of salt in wood due to treatment with salt-based preservatives or longtime exposure to seawater can result in inaccurate moisture content measurements.\nAdvantages\nSome of the advantages of moisture content measurement include the following:\nSimplicity.\nLow cost.\nWell-established field inspection technique.\nQuantitative information provided about the moisture content of wood members, which is a key biotic requirement for sustaining decay activity.\nLimitations\nSome limitations of moisture content measurement include the following:\nMoisture content measurement is not a direct measure of decay.\nConductance-type meters may not be useful for wood treated with salt-based preservatives, exposure to seawater, and treated with fire retardants.\nAdditional testing is needed to confirm the presence of decay.\nReferences\nWhite, R.

The technology is typically implemented using longitudinal (straight beam) or shear wave (angled beam) methods.\nLongitudinal wave methods are used to test surfaces not available for visual assessment, such as detecting cracks in bridge pins, trunnion shafts, or eyebars. Longitudinal wave methods may also be used for measuring the thickness of a steel plate to detect section loss or for imaging corrosion pits.\nShear wave methods (angled beam) are commonly used to inspect welds for flaws (figure 1).\nFigure 1. Illustration. PAUT Transducer Mounted on an Angled Wedge and Beam Paths for Inspecting a Butt Weld.\nDescription\nPAUT is a nondestructive evaluation technology used to detect defects such as cracks and weld flaws in steel bridge components. The technology uses acoustic waves launched from a transducer which propagate through the material and are reflected from discontinuities in the material. The reflected waves are detected by the transducer and analyzed. PAUT transducers are comprised of a number of sensor elements that generate and detect acoustic waves. Each individual element in the transducer launches an acoustic wave which combines in the material being tested to allow the resulting ultrasonic beam to be steered in different directions or focused at different depths. The ability to steer the ultrasonic beam in different directions increases the volume of material insonified from a single transducer position. This allows the technology to direct acoustic energy toward a particular location in the material being tested, allowing the wave beam to be scanned across the area where cracking is likely to initiate The beam steering capabilities of PAUT also provide full volumetric coverage of difficult to access areas.\nPhysical Principle \nPAUT detects defects using the same physical principles as conventional UT, launching an acoustic wave from a transducer and analyzing reflections from discontinuities and the physical boundaries of the material being tested. Conventional UT launches waves from a single element and receives (detects) waves using a single element. In contrast to conventional UT, PAUT uses multiple sensor elements to launch and receive acoustic waves. The physical principle of wave interference is used to combine waves launched from the individual sensors to form a beam of acoustic energy that propagates in a desired direction. This allows the wave beam direction to be controlled and \u201csteered\u201d in a desired direction or focused at a desired distance from a PAUT transducer.\nWave interference occurs when two or more acoustic waves occupy the same space at the same point in time. Figure 2 illustrates the effect of constructive interference on the amplitude of an acoustic wave. If wave A and wave B occupy the same space and are in phase as shown in the figure, these individual waves will combine to form a wave with an amplitude equal to the sum of the two individual wave amplitudes. This phenomenon is known as constructive interference. PAUT utilizes this phenomenon by launching waves from several individual sensor elements at different points in time, so the interference between the individual waves results in a plane wave propagating in a certain direction within the material being tested.(1)   \nFigure 2. Graph. Constructive Wave Interference, Where Wave A is In-Phase with Wave B, Resulting in a Combined Wave (A+B).\nFigure 3 illustrates the wave interference phenomenon used to control the direction of an acoustic wave beam launched from a series of individual sensor elements. In the figure, the sensor elements are represented as point sources for acoustic waves. Acoustic waves are launched from each individual sensor as the result of an excitation pulse. These excitation pulses are delayed in time (i.e., phased) to result in constructive interference of the individual waves within the material. In this manner, the acoustic wavefront can be \u201csteered\u201d or focused at a particular depth into the material by modifying the delay between the pulses from the individual sensors. \nFigure 3. Illustration. The Generation of a Plane Wave by Sequential Excitation of Individual Sensor Elements.\nData Acquisition\nPAUT utilizes transducers comprised of multiple sensor elements that launch and receive acoustic waves in the material being tested. Pulser circuitry in the instrument controls electronic pulses so individual sensors are excited at different points in time to transmit acoustic waves into the material being tested. This allows the shape and direction of the resulting beam of acoustic energy to be controlled so the beam may be steered at different angles or focused at different depths in the materials. Receiver circuitry in the instrument applies electronic delay to each sensor element to match the beam shape formed by the pulser. The received waveforms from each sensor may be combined into a single acoustic signal. This signal is digitized and stored in the computer.  \nFigure 4 shows a photograph of a typical PAUT instrument being used in the field (bottom). The battery-operated instrument contains the pulser-reciever circuitry and supporting software necessary to achieve beam forming, detect and store resulting waveforms, and produce different presentations of the data. A typical phased array transducer (top) attached to a refracting wedge that allows for angled beam testing using shear waves.\nFigure 4.  Photo. PAUT Instrument Transducer used to launch Angled Beams.\nData Processing \nWaveforms received by the transducer are digitized and stored. These data are presented in a variety of formats for interpretation by the operator. Common presentations include A-scans, displaying a single waveform, and sectorial scans, displaying the results of multiple waveforms combined to form a color-coded image.  \nThe A-scan display shown in figure 5 presents waveform amplitude versus time, the typical data presentation for conventional ultrasonic pulse-echo technologies.   \nA sectorial scan displays a color representation of wave amplitudes detected by the transducer. The display is formed from the combination of numerous A-scans captured as the beam is steered at different angles. To form the sectorial scan, the amplitude of each data point in an A-scan is assigned a color from a defined color palette (shown to the right of the sectorial scan in figure 5). The color representation of the amplitude of each individual A-scan produced as the wave beam is steered through the desired angles is then plotted. Using this graphical representation, indications that cause high amplitude reflections as the wave beam is steered through the desired angles appear as two-dimensional features on the sectorial scan. Data may also be presented in a C-scan format when a two-dimensional scanner is used to scan the transducer across the surface of the material being tested. The C-scan format presents the linear ordinate of the transducer on the x-axis and the color-coded amplitude of the A-scans across the transducer aperture plotted on the vertical axis. A spatial image showing areas of section loss and/or deep corrosion pits is produced.\nFigure 5. Composite Graph. Data Display from a PAUT Instrument.\nData Interpretation \nData is interpreted in the same manner for PAUT as for conventional pulse-echo UT. The amplitude of reflected waves is compared with a standard to assess if a given indication is acceptable or unacceptable. If a linear encoder is used during the data collection process, the length of indications may be estimated based on the data collected and stored. \nAdvantages \nCan detect both surface and subsurface flaws.\nCan assess areas that are inaccessible for visual inspection.\nImproved volumetric coverage and greater flexibility for testing complex geometries.\nComplete data records stored for future reference.\nLimitations  \nRequires surface preparation.\nRequires well-trained and experienced operators.\nIncreased cost of equipment as compared to conventional UT.\nReferences \nOlympus NDT, Inc.

This method involves gaining information in a test object by subjecting it to high energy electromagnetic radiation. The propagation of radiation through the test object is captured on a special photographic film on the opposite side of the specimen to produce a photograph like representation of the internal structure of the concrete.  \nPhysical Principle \nThe basic concept of gamma-ray radiography is illustrated in figure 1. A source transfers gamma-ray energy to a collimator through a guide tube by means of a telecontrol unit so that gamma rays impinge on the sample to be inspected. On the other side of the sample, an image plate registers the gamma-ray intensity traversing the sample. The lower the density of the material is, the higher the intensity of the gamma-ray energy that reaches the plate will be.  \nFigure 1. Illustration. Gamma-Ray Radiography Concept. \nSince concrete is about 2.5 times denser than biological tissues, x rays used in medicine are not suitable for concrete members. For this reason, concrete radiography usually employs gamma-ray sources instead of x-ray generators such as are used in medicine. Another advantage of gamma rays over x rays is gamma rays are emitted spontaneously by certain substances so electrical power is not required. An additional advantage of the 192Ir source is it can be housed in a small and relatively light container (~\u202f20 kg, 44lb). \nThe penetration of the gamma ray energy depends on its wavelength and energy level. The higher the source energy is, the greater the penetration of the gamma ray energy will be. \nFigure 2 shows how voids are readily identified by using the radiographic method. An empty soda bottle embedded in a concrete block irradiated with gamma rays from a 192Ir source can be readily identified. The attenuation produced by voids (air) is negligible. Hence radiation transmitted through a void in the interior of a concrete sample will produce a \u201cshadow\u201d darker than the areas where radiation traverses the full thickness of the concrete sample.  \nFigure 2. Radiograph. Empty Soda Bottle Embedded in a Concrete Block Irradiated with Gamma Rays From a 192Ir Source. \nSince steel attenuates gamma ray energy more than concrete, steel elements such as rebars or strands embedded in a concrete sample project a lighter \u201cshadow\u201d on the image plate. A severely corroded rebar with a nonuniform cross section projects on the image plate non-uniformly (figure 3). These are radiographs of a slab (left) and a tank wall (right) obtained with a 192Ir source. The radiograph on the left hand side also shows an electrical conduit to the right of a corroded rebar. The red lines in the lower part display the photographic density along the \u201ccuts,\u201d indicated by the blue lines on the radiograph. They help visualize the reduced cross section due to corrosion. \nFigure 3. Composite Graph. Radiograph of a Distorted Rebar Profile. \nData Acquisition\nImage plates, either conventional or more modern computed radiography (CR) image plates, record the gamma ray energy penetrated to the opposite side of a sample emitted from a 192Ir, 137Cs, or 60Co source. Conventional image plates must be developed after exposure, while CR image plates are converted into digitized images. The recording resolution of the CR image plates is about 5 times greater than that of conventional image plates. Plate size is usually 35 cm by 43 cm (14 inches by 17 inches). \nData Processing \nFigure 4 shows the detail obtained in an inspection done with the radiographic method of a post-tensioned box girder.(1) The horizontal band near the center is a post-tensioned cable. The impression of the duct can be seen in the insert. The other white lines in the right picture correspond to ordinary reinforcement, while the white rectangle is an external reference. These pictures show that this method is an appropriate tool for studying profiles of cables and ducts in post-tensioned and precast prestressed concrete girders. The quantitative determination of profiling defects is discussed below. \nIn the case of traditional radiographic methods where the image plates are film, the recorded data are the photographic density values at each point of the plate. The density is determined by measuring the intensity of the light transmitted through the plate when the plate is illuminated from the opposite side with a light source of constant and uniform intensity. The density is then compared with the expected value for a given configuration using a least squares fitting procedure to determine the profile of the tendon and the nature and extension of defects in the tendons as illustrated in figure 4. In the case of CR image plates, the gray level of each pixel is equivalent to density.  \nFigure 4. Composite Graph. Radiograph of a Distorted Rebar Profile.\nData Interpretation \nFigure 5 shows an example of profiling tendons in post-tensioned concrete girders using film radiography. The girder contains two ducts, one of them having a severe grouting defect.(2) The data interpretation involves examining the density D(xo,z), where xo is the x-coordinate of the vertical dotted line in the radiograph in figure 5. The data points in the plot on the right hand side of figure 5 are the values of D(xo,z). \nFigure 5. Composite Graph. Interpretation of Radiograph.(2) \nIn the right figure, the \u201cbowl\u201d shapes in the intervals A-B and D-E correspond to the cables. The \u201cpeak density,\u201d corresponding to the dark band above the cable in the upper duct, is the manifestation of a void in this duct. The thin line in the right plot corresponds to the calculated density values. \nThe parameters in red were adjusted to fit the data. The positions and diameters of cables and ducts were obtained from the measured data and by tomographic analysis. The obtained value of the \u201cvoid\u201d density determines the depth of the void as 5 cm air equivalent, and the small difference between the measured and calculated D values in the interval D-E may be an indication that the cable section is reduced by up to about 7 mm.\nAdvantages \nProduces \u201cphotographic\u201d quality results and precise locating of reinforcement for condition assessment, void detection, and grout condition assessment.  \nSmall, portable source systems. \nSome source systems, such as those employed with 192Ir source, are easy to shield and Can be used in the field without interrupting traffic or causing disturbances to the general public. \nLimitations  \nRequires precautionary measures against gamma rays. Public exposure to radiations must always be below the limits set by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and State regulations. \nSmall, portable gamma ray source systems can only penetrate concrete elements of the thickness up to about 300 mm.

A more detailed quantitative analysis can be carried out by examining the photographic density D(x,z) (i.e., the \u201cgray\u201d level) along different zi-lines.  \nFigure 4. Radiograph. Concrete Wall with Honeycombing.(1) \nData Interpretation \nData interpretation for detecting voids is straightforward. Voids visually manifest as relatively darker areas in the radiograph of a concrete sample. However, other phenomena can result in relatively darker images. For instance, relative to the lighter shadow projected by reinforcing bars, the rest of the plate will appear darker. These situations are easily identified since the rebars project a well-defined shape. Another, more subtle effect is due to the intensity of the radiation falling onto the plate being not only a function of the attenuation of the materials it traverses but also of the inverse of the square of the gamma-ray path length d. If d is comparable to the dimensions (x,z) of the plate, the radiation intensity will be noticeably higher, producing a darker zone near the point at which d is smallest. That is the point (xo,zo) at which the line from the source perpendicular to the plate intersects the plate. In these cases, the photographic density D(x,z) on the plate will diminish regularly as (x,z) is farther from (xo,zo), exhibiting circles of equal photographic density.    \nFigure 5 shows an example where these two effects combine to make identifying a void difficult. The radiograph in figure 5 corresponds to a concrete structure with several rebars (numbered vertical light gray bands) and a few stirrups (horizontal light gray lines). The small white rectangle with black dots, the label above it and the thin vertical metallic segment are external reference elements. \nThe source-to-plate distance in this measurement was only 22 cm. In order to determine whether the darker area at the center of the radiograph corresponds to a void or not, the photographic density along the dotted line was measured (red data points in the lower plot) and compared with the expected (calculated) photographic density. \nThe green and magenta lines on the graph in figure 5 are the calculated photographic densities with and without steel bars. The good agreement between the measured data and the calculations indicates that the dark areas extending from near the center towards the borders of the radiograph are not due to a void but rather to the variation of the gamma-ray path length among the different points\nFigure 5.

The flat end bit (figure 1) moves through a wood member at a known rate and generates resistance information to determine the depth and extent of low-resistance areas at high precision.\nPhysical Principle\nThe electrical consumption of the resistance drill is proportional to the mechanical torque applied to the needle and mainly depends on the wood density. In other words, resistance microdrilling detects the low-density regions of wood potentially caused by decay and deterioration.(1)\nData Acquisition\nResistance microdrills collect and store data electronically, and they can provide a chart or a hard copy representing the relative resistance of wood over the drilling path.(1) Recent models have capabilities to visualize data on a tablet or cell phone during field testing. The data can be further analyzed in the office. Depending on the density of the wood species, sound regions of wood show different levels of resistance. In contrast, voids show zero resistance against drilling (figure 2). Through observing the variation of resistance during drilling, an inspector can identify and quantify the extent of decay as low, moderate, or severe in wood members. After drilling, the drilling hole is typically filled with a small amount of silicone sealant or marine adhesive.(1) While resistance microdrilling is typically performed perpendicular to wood members, it is also possible to drill a member at an angle to assess the condition of wood below the ground line, shown in figure 3.\nSource: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service.\nFigure 1. End of resistance microdrill needles (bits) [1].\nSource: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service.\nFigure 2. Data.

Resistance microdrilling perpendicular to the member surface.\nSource: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service.\nB. Resistance microdrilling at an angle.\nFigure 3. Photos. Perpendicular and angled Resistance microdrilling.(1)\nData Processing\nDrilling charts should be reviewed by the inspector in the field, and notes should be taken on the charts to identify the location of drilling The instrument is often equipped with a laptop and software for a better observation of the data (figure 2).\nData Interpretation\nCare must be taken not to interpret the sound of softwood (i.e., conifers) as decayed wood. The center section of the softwood (close to the pitch) is often softer than its outer section because it lacks the growth rings present in the outer region. (1) The type of wood being drilled matters. While the resistance of hardwood can be greater than 50 percent, the resistance of softwood can vary in the range of 15\u201350-plus percent. Drilling should be performed across the whole cross section of the member because some wood species may show constantly low resistance during the test.\n The drilling resistance from different manufacturers can be substantially different due to factors such as different scales applied to the data. A guideline for determining various decay levels is presented in table 1.(1)\nTable 1. Guideline for estimating the decay level of Douglas-fir and southern yellow pine using the resistance microdrill data [1].\nResistance level (%) * Decay level Comments\n> 20+ None to low Sound wood often shows consistent resistance across the full width\n5-15 Moderate It often represents areas near void\n0 Severe Typically represents voids\n*Values can substantially vary between manufacturers.\nAdvantages\nAdvantages of resistance microdrilling include the following:\nResistance microdrilling provides quantitative data about the condition of wood members.\nResistance microdrilling is simple.\nResistance microdrilling provides an accurate depth of decay.\nResistance microdrilling is well developed.\nResistance microdrilling does not require access to the opposing side of wood members.\nLimitations\nSome of the limitations of resistance microdrilling include the following:\nThis technique involves localized measurements.\nThe test is mainly used to confirm the presence of decay but can also be used to determine depth of checks.\nThe accessibility to the member of interest can be limited. There must be enough space for fitting the drill and drilling through the entire thickness of a member.(2) Typically, this is not an issue with bridges, where an inspector can drill vertically from the bottom side upward, even in the case of closely paced bridge girders.\nThe weight of the device can cause fatigue for the inspector after several drillings.(2)\nThe intended drill path can deflect from a straight line when the drill bit is boring tangentially to the growth rings.\nReferences\nWhite, R.

        "text": "NDE\nBridge\nSounding\nTechnology\nSounding\nExport PDF\nTarget of Investigation\nSounding including chain drag and hammer sounding are mainly used to detect moderate to severe delamination in concrete structures. Chain drag is limited to horizontal surfaces, and hammer sounding can be used for a wider range of structures.\nDescription\nThe most common visual inspection methods used by State transportation departments and other bridge owners for detection of delamination in concrete bridge decks are chain drag and hammer sounding. The objective of these methods is to detect regions of the deck where the sound from dragging the chain or hitting with a hammer changes from a clear ringing sound (sound deck) to a somewhat mute and hollow sound (delaminated deck).(1)\nChain drag (figure 1) is a fast method for determining the location of moderate to severe delaminated area. The speed of chain drag varies with the level of deterioration of the deck and the experience of the inspector.\nFigure 1. Photo. Chain Drag.(1)\nHammer sounding (figure 2) is a slower and more appropriate method for smaller areas. Hammer sounding can be used in conjunction with chain drag in order to better define the size and extent of a delamination.\nFigure 2. Photo. Hammer Sounding.(1)\nPhysical Principle \nChain drag and hammer sounding can be categorized as crude vibrational modal tests. The operator drags chains or strikes a hammer on the deck, listening to the resulting sound. A clear ringing sound represents a sound deck while a mute/hollow sound represents a delaminated area.(1) The hollow sound is a result of the flexural oscillations of the delaminated section of the deck, creating a drum-like effect. Flexural oscillation of a delaminated area is typically in a 1 to 3 kHz range. This is within the audible range of a human ear.\nData Acquisition\nChain dragging is carried out using a custom-made tool consisting of one or more steel chains attached to a handle so that the operator can drag or swing the chains (figure 3).\nFigure 3. Photo. Chain Drag Tool.(2)\nFor hammer sounding, any normal masonry hammer can be used (figure 4).\nFigure 4. Photo. Hammers.(2)\nFor chain dragging, the operator drags the chain on the deck while listening to the sound that the chain makes.(3) Delaminated areas will be detected based on the audible response of the deck. A clear ringing sound represents a sound deck while a mute/hollow sound represents a delaminated deck. The operator marks the locations that are perceived as delaminated.\nChain drag gives a more general indication of the delamination location. To get more accurate information about the size and shape of the delamination, hammer sounding can be conducted by tapping the concrete surface with an ordinary masonry hammer and listening for the response. Similar to the chain drag, a clear ringing sound represents a sound deck while a mute/hollow sound represents the delaminated deck. The operator marks the detected delaminated areas during the survey. \nThe figures below depict the testing procedure on a bridge deck followed by the markings of the delaminated regions on the deck (figure 5).\nFigure 5. Photo. Delamination Markings.(4)\nFor complete testing procedures please refer to ASTM D4580-03(2007), Standard Practice for Measuring Delaminations in Concrete Bridge Decks by Sounding.(3)\nData Processing \nMarked areas can be mapped on a grid or placed in drawing/mapping software for output; however, no processing of acquired data is needed.\nData Interpretation \nA typical map based on the chain drag/hammer sounding is shown in figure 6. The hatched areas correspond to the delaminated regions detected by chain drag and hammer sounding. \nFigure 6. Contour Map.

        "text": "NDE\nBridge\nStress Wave Timing\nTechnology\nStress Wave Timing\nExport PDF\nTarget of investigations\nStress wave timing is used to detect the areas of internal decay in wood structures.\nDescription\nStress wave timing aims to investigate the presence of flaws and decay in wood materials by determining the travel time of stress waves as they propagate from the source to the receiver.\nPhysical Principle\nIn undamaged materials, the velocity of stress waves is directly proportional to their elastic modulus. In the presence of flaws, such as checks and splits, however, the velocity tends to decrease and stress wave timing tends to increase.  Therefore, waves need to take a longer travel path from the source to the receiver to bypass the flawed region. Furthermore, due to the increased softness of decayed wood, it generally takes longer for stress waves to travel in decayed wood than sound wood of the same type. It is worth noting that since wood is an anisotropic material, its mechanical properties (and subsequently stress wave velocity) are affected by the orientation of propagating waves with respect to grains. Moisture and preservative treatment can also affect the stress wave timing results. In the following paragraphs, factors affecting the stress wave timing results are explained in further detail.\nFiber orientation\nThe direction of the stress waves propagating in a wood member affects the wave velocity measurements.(1) For structural wood members, fibers are oriented more or less along the length of a member. During measurements, tapping the end grain of a wood member generates longitudinal waves with the highest wave velocity (lowest stress wave transmission time), while tapping the side of a wood member (i.e., across grains) generates transverse waves with the lowest wave velocity (largest stress wave transmission time). For example, for Douglas fir and southern pine, the stress wave transmission times along the grain are approximately 200 \u00b5s/m (60 \u00b5s/ft), while the transmission times across grains are in the range of 850 \u00b5s/m and 1,000 \u00b5s/m (259 \u00b5s/ft and 305 \u00b5s/ft).(1)\nRing orientation\nThe stress wave transmission time is shortest at the radial direction and longest at 45 degrees to the annual ring orientation (figure 1).(1) In the radial direction, transmission time is approximately 30 percent shorter than 45 degrees to the annual ring orientation.(1) For good quality wood at 12 percent moisture content, the transmission time of 668 \u03bcs/m (203 \u00b5s/ft) in the radial direction, 800 \u03bcs/m (244 \u00b5s/ft) in the tangential direction, and 995 \u03bcs/m (303 \u00b5s/ft) in the 45 degrees to the annual ring orientation is expected (figure 1). Depending on the wood species, these values can vary \u00b110 percent.(1) For glulam (also known as glued laminated timber) members, the transmission time for each layer can vary depending on the ring orientation.\nSource: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service.\nA. Travel paths.\nSource: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service.\nB. Transmission time affected by the orientation of annual rings.\nSource: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service.\nC. Typical transmission times in a glulam member.\n\nFigure 1. Schematics and Graph. Transverse stress waves in timber. The annual ring orientation in the first top two layers is mainly radial, in the second top two layers\u2014mainly 45 degrees, and in the third top two layers is mainly tangential.(1)\nDecay\nThe presence of decay significantly affects the transmission time across wood grains, while it may not substantially affect the transmission time parallel to grains. A 30 percent increase in transmission time perpendicular to grain suggests 50 percent strength loss, and a 50 percent increase of transmission time perpendicular to grain indicates severe decay.(1) Transverse travel paths are best suited for finding decay. Parallel-to-grain travel paths can bypass regions of decay.\nMoisture content\nThe stress wave transmission time perpendicular to the grain tends to decrease with moisture content below the fiber saturation point (FSP), approximately 30 percent, and it remains relatively constant for moisture levels higher than FSP (figure 2).(1) Depending on the moisture content and temperature of the wood during testing, adjustment factors can be applied to the transmission time results (table 1).(1)\nSource: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service.\nFigure 2.

However, depending on the penetration depth, oil-borne preservatives can increase the transmission time of stress waves up to 40 percent higher than that of the untreated wood.(1) The depth of preservative penetration in round poles generally varies between 37 and 61 mm (1.5 to 2.5 inch).(1) Table 2 shows an example of the estimated transmission times for poles of varying diameter as the penetration depth of preservatives varies.\nTable 2.

Because both accelerometers are connected to the stress timer, the time difference between generating and receiving the signal is recorded (figure 3).\nSource: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service.\nFigure 3. Schematic. Illustration of the principle of stress wave timing tests.(1)\nThe use of stress wave timing for locating defects in timber structures is limited by accessing both sides of a member. This technique is particularly useful for assessing sawn lumber or glulam timber members with a thickness greater than or equal to 3.5 inches, where hammer sounding is not effective.(1) Depending on the frequency of excitation, the stress waves are referred to as sonic or ultrasonic. Sonic frequencies are between 20 Hz and 20 kHz, and ultrasonic frequencies are greater than 20 kHz. The application of a hammer and accelerometers for generating and receiving stress waves is mainly limited to the sonic frequencies. For generating and receiving ultrasonic waves, piezoelectric transducers should be used. Couplant is also required for attaching the transducers to the member when using ultrasonic measurement systems. Stress timing units generally produce comparable results when calibrated following the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations.(1)\nData Processing\nNo data processing is required\nData Interpretation\nIn the physical principle section, several factors affecting the stress wave transmission time were discussed. For field applications, as a first step, a baseline transmission time (Tbaseline (\u00b5s)) using the wave transmission distance (WTD) for differentiating between sound versus potentially decayed wood should be defined. Transmission times smaller than Tbaseline (\u00b5s) indicate sound wood, while those larger than Tbaseline (\u00b5s) suggest potentially degraded members. WTD is a member thickness for the transverse wave transmission time measurements, and 1,000 (\u00b5s/m) can be used as a general baseline transmission time when WTD is expressed in meters. Similarly, 300 (\u00b5s/ft) is the general baseline transmission time when WTD is expressed in feet. A baseline transmission time can also be determined onsite by testing sound sections of the wood members.\nStress wave timing techniques should be used in areas with a high chance of deterioration, such as near bearings points and connections. The general baseline transmission time serves as a starting point in the inspection. Tests should be performed at various distances from the region of interest. The stress wave transmission times for sound wood show small variations. If substantial variations are observed in test results, the member should be specified as suspect.(1)\nAdvantages\nSome advantages of stress wave timing include the following:\nThe technique provides information about the physical and mechanical properties of wood because the wood elastic modulus is inversely proportional to the stress wave timing values.\nThe technique is well developed and easy to use.\nThe technique is appropriate for testing thick timber members where hammer sounding is not effective.\nLimitations\nLimitations of stress wave timing include the following:\nTraining is required.\nAccess to both sides of a wood member are required.\nAffects results due to defects other than decay, such as internal checks, cracks, and splits.\nTakes extra time since measurements need to be performed at multiple locations.\nReferences\nWhite, R.

This technique is useful because inspecting each member of a structural system is time-consuming, and sometimes accessing wood members can be difficult.(1)\nDescription\nTransverse vibration aims to capture the resonance frequency of a structural system, such as a timber bridge superstructure, and use it to estimate the EI of the system, where E is the elastic modulus, and I is the moment of inertia (inch4 or m4).(1,2) EI represents the system\u2019s condition.\nPhysical Principle\nAccording to the transverse vibration results from the laboratory and field bridges, the vibration response of single-span bridges can be modeled using the theory for simply supported one-way beams.(2) For a timber beam, the theoretical relationship between E and the resonance frequency (fr) is as follows:\nFigure 1. Equation. The theoretical relationship between E and the resonance frequency (fr).\nWhere W is the beam weight (lb or kg), L is the beam span (inch or m), g is the gravitational acceleration, and n is related to the support condition. For a simply supported beam, n = 2.46, and for a fixed-supported beam, n = 12.65.(1)\nFor an undamaged system, an agreement between test results and the theoretical value is expected. However, as a structural system deteriorates, its EI tends to decrease, and it deviates from its theoretical value.(1)\nData Acquisition\nTo estimate the resonance frequency, free or forced vibration can be applied to a structural system. In free vibration, the excitation force is impacted by a large hammer to deflect the structure, while in forced vibration, a motor with an eccentric rotating mass excites the structure. In the forced vibration, the resonance frequency is estimated by changing the speed of the rotating mass to observe the maximum deflection in the structure. The deflection can be estimated using linear variable differential transducers (LVDT) attached to the structure and connected to an oscilloscope.(1,2) Similarly, an LVDT can be used to capture the deflection during the free vibration testing (also known as modal testing.(2))\nData Processing\nIn practice, the output of the oscilloscope\u2014time-deflection data\u2014is used to estimate the resonance frequency.(1) Using equation 1, the resonance frequency enables estimating the with 95 percent confidence, which allows for variability due to materials and construction. Then, by measuring the floor span (L) and estimating the weight of the flooring, EI can be calculated to represent the condition of the structural system.(1)\nData Interpretation\nNo data interpretation is required\nAdvantages\nTransverse vibration of structural systems includes the following advantages:\nProvides information about the condition of the whole bridge system.\nSaves time and eliminates accessibility issues compared to individual testing of bridge components.\nFocuses on the quality of connections, while the majority of NDE techniques focus on the quality of individual members.\nLimitations\nSome of the limitations with transverse vibration include the following:\nThe current method of analysis is limited to single-span bridge systems.\nThe test evaluates the overall condition of a structure and fails to provide information about the condition of bridge components.\nReferences\nWhite, R.

        "text": "NDE\nBridge\nUltrasonic Surface Waves (USW)\nTechnology\nUltrasonic Surface Waves (USW)\nExport PDF\nTarget of Investigation\nThe ultrasonic surface waves (USW) technique has the following applications:(1) \nConcrete quality control and evaluation (modulus and strength, using the correlation with modulus). \nIndirect assessment of delamination in bridge decks. \nEstimates of the depth of vertical cracks within bridge decks or other elements. \nCondition assessment through evaluating probable material damage from various causes: alkali-silica reaction (ASR), fire, freeze-thaw, and other cracking processes. \nDescription\nThe USW technique is an offshoot of the spectral analysis of surface waves (SASW) method used in evaluating material properties (elastic moduli) in the very near surface zone. SASW utilizes the phenomenon of the surface wave dispersion, i.e., velocity of propagation as a function of frequency and wavelength, in layered systems to obtain information about layer thickness and elastic moduli.(2) The USW test is identical to the SASW test except that the frequency range of interest is limited to a narrow high frequency range where the velocity of the surface wave (phase velocity) does not vary significantly with frequency. The surface wave velocity can be converted to the material modulus, concrete modulus in the case of bridge decks, using either the measured or assumed mass density or Poisson\u2019s ratio of the material. A USW test consists of recording the response of the deck at two receiver locations due to an impact on the surface of the deck. \nFigure 1. Photo. Ultrasonic Surface Waves (USW) Equipment.(2) \nPhysical Principle \nSurface waves are elastic waves that travel along the free surface of a medium and, in most cases, is the predominant part of energy in comparison to body waves\u2014compressive (P- waves) and shear waves (Swaves).(2) The arrival of the surface (Rayleigh) wave follows the arrival of the two body wave components because it is the slowest one (figure 2). \nFigure 2. Graph. Typical Time Record Used in Surface-Wave Method.(2)\nThe surface waves propagate radially from the impact source, forming a cylindrical front with a velocity dependent on the elastic properties of the medium. The waves propagating in a heterogeneous medium are dispersive; that is, waves of different wavelengths or frequencies travel with different velocities. Thus, the information about the subsurface can be obtained through measuring the phase velocity versus frequency relationship (dispersion curve) and back calculation of the dispersion curve to obtain the profile of the tested system.\u202f \nSurface wave energy extends to a depth of approximately one wavelength. At wavelengths less than or equal to the thickness of the layer, the velocity of surface-wave propagation is more or less independent of wavelength (figure 3). Therefore, if the measurement is limited to wavelengths not exceeding the thickness of the deck, the velocity of surface waves will be dependent only on the concrete modulus. An average velocity is used to correlate it to the concrete modulus. Significant variation in the phase velocity indicates the presence of delamination or other anomaly. Elastic waves are generated by means of impacts, detected by a pair or an array of receivers and recorded by a transient recorder. \nFigure 3. Illustration. Surface-wave Velocity vs. Wavelength (top) and Evaluation of a Layer Modulus by SASW (USW) Method (bottom).(2)\nData Acquisition\nThe basic components of USW equipment include a source, at least one pair of receivers, and a portable computer with controls and data acquisition software.(1) The USW equipment enables both automatic and semi-automatic data collection and data processing. Figure 4 shows an example of a simple USW device, called portable seismic property analyzer (PSPA), with a solenoid type impact source and two receivers (accelerometers). Once the device is placed on the ground, a series of impacts from the source is detected by the receiver pair and recorded on a portable computer.\nFigure 4. Photo. USW Testing Using PSPA in a Mobile Cart.(1)  \nData Processing \nIn most systems, compressional waves arrive at the receivers first, followed by shear waves and then surface waves.(3) However, more than two-thirds of the energy in the wave train is in the surface waves, making them more easily studied. Figure 5 illustrates the relative arrival of the wave train at a near and far receiver. Figure 6 shows how a phase lag in the arrival of a wave component to two or more receiver locations can be used to measure the travel time between them. The received signals are processed, and a subsequent calculation scheme is used to calculate the concrete modulus directly in the field (figure 7).(4\nFigure 5. Graph. Recorded Waveforms.(3)\n\nFigure 6. Illustration. Velocity Calculation.(3)\n\nFigure 7. Photo. Testing Device (left) and Screen (right) During Data Collection.(2)\nData Interpretation \nData from USW testing are typically presented in terms of the concrete modulus distribution (figure 8). Very low modulus is often an indication of presence of delamination or cracking and does not necessarily represent the actual concrete modulus at the test location. \nFigure 8. Contour Map.

UT is often used for determining the thickness of a test member. Thickness gages are commonly used for the detection of section loss resulting from corrosion in steel bridge members.\nUT technology can also be applied to in-service bridges to detect and/or monitor the following:\nCracks in steel bridge members.\nWeld flaws such as cracks, slag inclusions, weld porosity, or lack of fusion in steel bridge members.\nCracks in steel bridge components such as pins, hangers, and eyebars.\nFractured anchor bolts.\nThickness of a steel plate.\nLength of a bridge pin or anchor bolt.\nThe technology is applied during the fabrication of welded members to ensure weld quality.(1,2,3)\nDescription\nUT for flaw detection is a nondestructive method in which high-frequency acoustic waves are introduced into a material by a transducer placed on the surface. The acoustic wave propagates through the material and is reflected by discontinuities in the material. The reflected acoustic waves are detected by the transducer. The resulting waveform is analyzed to identify reflections that may be caused by discontinuities in the material. The technology can be used to detect weld flaws such as cracks, inclusions, weld porosity, or lack of fusion. The technology can also be used to detect cracks in steel members and components.(1) UT is implemented using one of two different configurations, straight-beam (figure 1) or angled-beam (figure 2 and figure 3).\nFigure 1. Illustration. Straight-beam Ultrasonic Test of a Bridge Pin.\nFigure 2. Illustration. Angled-beam-beam Ultrasonic Test of a Bridge Pin.\nFigure 3. Illustration. Angled-beam Ultrasonic Test of a transition butt-weld plate.\nPhysical Principle \nThe physical principle of UT is that an acoustic waves (sound waves, elastic waves, or mechanical waves) passing through a material will be fully or partially reflected by discontinuities in the material or a boundary of the material. Acoustic waves are introduced into the material using an ultrasonic transducer placed on the surface. The transducer launches an acoustic wave that passes through the material and is reflected by discontinuities within the material and boundaries of the material. After the wave has passed through the material, an ultrasonic transducer is used to detect and display the resulting waveform. The waveform is analyzed to assess reflections from back wall or those caused by discontinuities in the material and the boundaries of the material.(1)\nData Acquisition\nData is acquired by using a hand-held, battery-operated ultrasonic flaw detector. The flaw detector is comprised of an ultrasonic pulser-receiver that generates and detects the acoustic waves, a screen on which waveforms are displayed, and a control panel where adjustments to instrument parameters can be made. On-board data storage is typically provided where waveforms and other test data can be saved. UT is implemented using one of two different configurations, straight-beam or angled-beam.\nStraight-beam testing is applied in the field for detecting defects in pins, trunnion shafts, anchor bolts, and other steel bridge components. Straight-beam testing launches a longitudinal wave normal or nearly normal to the surface of the material being tested. Figure 4 illustrates the application of straight-beam ultrasonic testing for the detection of a crack in an anchor bolt. Small angles of up to 10\u00b0 may be used to improve the alignment of the beam path with the alignment of a defect or to improve coverage when access to the surface of the material is limited. For example, the transducer may aligned at a slight angle relative to the axis of the bolt to focus ultrasonic energy on the barrel of the pin where cracks are likely to initiate.\nFigure 4. Photo.  Straight-beam Ultrasonic Transducer Being Used to Inspect an anchor bolt.\nAngled-beam testing is used for detecting flaws in welds (figure 5). This configuration is commonly used for fabrication inspection and may also be applied in the field. Angled-beam testing launches a shear wave into the material being tested at an angle of 33\u00b0 or greater; standard angles are 45\u00b0, 60\u00b0 and 70\u00b0. The angled ultrasonic beam penetrates the weld area after reflecting from the back side of the plate.\nFigure 5. Photo. Angled-beam Transducer on the Surface of a Test Plate.\nData Processing \nData processing for flaw detection consists of amplifying the received acoustic waveforms to obtain a relative signal magnitude that allows the reflected wave amplitude to be compared to a standard. The required amplification (in dB) to match the magnitude of the reflected amplitude to the standard is measured and recorded\nData Interpretation \nData interpretation for flaw detection consists of comparing the amplitude of a detected waveform with a standard. Reflected waveforms that exceed a certain amplitude threshold relative to the side drilled hole are interpreted as flaws. Reflected waveforms that do not exceed the threshold are interpreted as noise or non-relevant indications.(2) \nAdvantages \nRapid, low cost, widely available technology.\nAccess to only one surface of the plate is required, providing the ability to assess areas inaccessible for visual inspection.\nMinimal training required.\nUT can detect both surface and subsurface flaws.\nLimitations  \nSurface preparation is required to achieve highly accurate results.\nTime consuming.\nWell trained operators required.\nReferences \nAmerican Society of Nondestructive Testing (ASNT) Handbook, 3rd Edition, Volume 7, Ultrasonic Testing (ET),\n2005.AWS, Bridge Welding Code , AWS D1.5, American Welding Society, Miami, FL, 2010.\nMoore, M., Phares, B, and Washer, G.,Guidelines for Ultrasonic Inspection of Hanger Pins, FHWA, ed., USDOT, Washingon, D.C., 99, 2004\nLast updated on August 17, 2022",

The thickness of a material is measured based on the travel time of an ultrasonic wave that propagates through the material. A single transducer is used to launch an acoustic wave that propagates through the material to be reflected from the opposite surface and then detected by the transducer (figure 1). The time of flight (TOF) of the ultrasonic wave is determined based on the arrival time of the wave. The thickness of the material is determined from an equation (figure 2).\nFigure 1. Illustration. Ultrasonic Thickness Measurement Showing the Ultrasonic Beam Path through a Material.\nFigure 2. Equation. Thickness of Material.(1)\nWhere:\nd =  Thickness of the material (inches).\nTOF = The time of flight of the acoustic wave (secs).\nC = Wave velocity in the material  (inches/sec).\nUltrasonic thickness measurements are made with an ultrasonic thickness gauge, a hand-held, battery-operated instrument that displays the thickness measurement on a digital display.(1)\nPhysical Principle \nThe physical principle of UT is that an acoustic waves (sound waves, elastic waves, or mechanical waves) passing through a material will be fully or partially reflected by discontinuities in the material or a boundary of the material. Acoustic waves are introduced into the material using an ultrasonic transducer placed on the surface.

A digital display on the device indicates the measured thickness values. Some thickness gages also display data graphically to indicate thickness measurements at different locations. For example, some instruments can be attached to an encoder and graphically display the measured data along a scan line that is one-dimensional (a B-scan) or a grid that is two-dimensional (a C-scan). Measured data is stored in on-board memory and can be downloaded to a computer for reporting and further analysis.\nFigure 3. Photo. UT Thickness Gage Instrumentation and Transducer.\nData Processing \nData processing for thickness measurements typically consists of a simple timing measurement to determine the time it took the acoustic wave to travel from the transducer through the material, reflect off the opposite surface, and return to the transducer. This travel time, known as the time of flight (TOF) of the acoustic wave, is then used to estimate the length of the travel path (e.g., the thickness of a plate) based on the velocity of an acoustic wave in the material. These data are shown of a digital display or graphical display, as previously described. \nData Interpretation \nMost ultrasonic thickness gages provide a measurement of the travel path, requiring very little data interpretation to determine these measured values. These data are commonly interpreted for the purpose of assessing the extent of section loss due to corrosion. For example, if a steel plate with corrosion damage has an original thickness of 1 inch, and an ultrasonic thickness gage determines the actual thickness is only 0.75 inches; these data are interpreted to indicate 25 percent section loss.   \nAdvantages \nRapid, low cost, widely available technology.\nAccess to only one surface of the plate is required, providing the ability to assess areas inaccessible for visual inspection.\nMinimal training required.\nUT can detect both surface and subsurface flaws.\nLimitations  \nSurface preparation is required to achieve highly accurate results.\nTime consuming.\nWell trained operators required.\nReferences \nAmerican Society of Nondestructive Testing (ASNT) Handbook, 3rd Edition, Volume 7, Ultrasonic Testing (ET),\n2005.AWS, Bridge Welding Code , AWS D1.5, American Welding Society, Miami, FL, 2010.\nMoore, M., Phares, B, and Washer, G.,Guidelines for Ultrasonic Inspection of Hanger Pins, FHWA, ed., USDOT, Washingon, D.C., 99, 2004.\nLast updated on July 26, 2021",

        "text": "NDE\nBridge\nUltrasonic Tomography (UST)\nTechnology\nUltrasonic Tomography (UST)\nExport PDF\nTarget of Investigation\nUPE method is primarily used to inspect interiors of concrete structural members and tunnel linings for the following applications: \nMeasuring thickness of concrete members. \nDetecting voids in grouted tendon ducts. \nDetecting poor bonding or debonding of overlays and repairs. \nDetecting delaminations. \nDetecting voids and honeycombing in concrete members. \nLocating ducts and reinforcement in concrete structures, like rebars, strands, and tendons.  \nQuality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) during construction of reinforced and prestressed concrete elements. \nDetecting voids behind tunnel linings and below slabs on grade. \nDescription\nThe UPE method involves using dry contact transmitting and receiving ultrasonic transducers in a \u201cpitch-catch\u201d configuration which emit shear waves into the concrete and detect and record reflections from objects of different acoustic impedances. UPE equipment is available in different sizes, varying from two transducers to a large number of transducers in an array arrangement (figure 1).  \nSome systems use multiple transducers to serve as transmitters and receivers to accelerate the ultrasonic data acquisition, enhance the signal to noise ratio, and minimize effects of wave scattering from aggregate particles and similar inhomogeneities in concrete structures. Such systems with a large number of transducers are used for ultrasonic tomography.(1) A device known as MIRA, with an array of forty-eight low-frequency broadband shear transducers, is shown in figure 2. While one of the rows of transducers is acting as a transmitter, the remaining rows of transducers are acting as receivers. Each transducer is mechanically isolated and dampened independently that can fit the profile of a rough concrete testing surface. \nFigure 1. Photo. UPE Probe with Twenty-Four Shear Transducers. \nFigure 2. Photo. Ultrasonic Tomographer. \nPhysical Principle \nThe UPE method involves generating and recording ultrasonic compression and shear waves being propagated through the surveyed object and reflected from objects of different acoustic impedances. As illustrated in figure 3, the transducer probe generates the wave field while the receiving probe detects and records the reflected waves. UPE testing defines the depth of the reflector (internal flaws such as cracking, voids, delamination, or horizontal cracking) by measuring the round trip travel time (\u0394t) of the pulse and using the wave propagation velocity (C) in the investigated material.(2) The calculation of depth (d) is illustrated in figure 4. \nFigure 3. Illustration. Ultrasonic Pulse Echo Physical Principle.\nFigure 4. Equation. Calculation of Depth of Reflector.\nWhen the transducers are enclosed in an array box (figure 1), the control unit in the antenna excites the first three rows of transducers, and the other rows of transducers act as receivers. In an ultrasonic tomography device with an array of forty-eight shear transducers, while one of the rows of transducers is acting as a transmitter, the remaining rows of transducers are acting as receivers. The ray paths for the measured transit time are shown in figure 5. This process is repeated until each of the rows of transducers has acted as transmitters. \nFigure 5. Illustration. Transmission and Reception of Shear Waves in Ultrasonic Tomography. \nIn general, it is critical to have good coupling between the surface and the transducers. In the past, coupling was achieved by using coupling media. Some newer systems have the individual transducers spring loaded to conform to the surface and, thus, do not require any couplants. The nominal center frequency for units using shear waves is usually between 20 to 200 kHz. For most concrete applications, a center frequency of 50 kHz will yield better results. \nData Acquisition\nThe UPE system consists of transducers, a portable computer with analysis software, and a data cable that connects the sensor unit to the portable computer. For ultrasonic tomography, the transducers and the electronics are mounted in a handheld box to be applied on concrete surfaces. Figure 6 shows data collection with an ultrasonic tomographer known as MIRA.\nWhile it is necessary to adapt test procedures to the needs of the desired application, the basic steps for different collection modes are described herein. Before the start of the actual testing, check the instrument settings by examining a few locations with known conditions. This is described as a review or explore mode. The actual testing should be conducted on a pre-defined grid to obtain a complete data set for the element surveyed. This is described as the map or scan mode.\nFigure 6. Photo. Data Collection Using Ultrasonic Tomographer.\nData Processing \nAfter all the data are collected and stored, a data reconstruction calculation, Synthetic Aperture Focusing Technique (SAFT), is performed, resulting in a 3-D representation of the surveyed objects with features in the image indicating reflections from objects and discontinuities. In the 3-D volume, the position and strength of reflections from identified reflectors are presented by a color scheme and can be used to obtain the actual position and shape of the reflector. The 3-D volume can be examined by presenting various cutting vertical or horizontal planes. Images of detected features in three such planes, termed the B-scan, C-scan, and D-scan, are shown in figure 7. The B-scan is an image slice showing the depth of the specimen on the vertical (z) axis versus the width of scan on the horizontal (x) axis. This slice is a plane perpendicular to the scanning surface and parallel to the length of the device. The C-scan is an image slice showing the plan view of the tested area, with the vertical (y) axis of the scan depicting the width parallel to the scanning direction and the horizontal (x) axis of the scan, representing the length perpendicular to the scanning direction. The D-scan is like the B-scan which images a plane perpendicular to the testing surface, but it is oriented parallel to the scanning direction. \nFigure 7. Illustration. B-scan, C-scan, and D-scan.\nData Interpretation \nThe 3-D visualization along with different plane sections (B-, C-, and D-scans) can be used to interpret the data. A color template is used to describe features depending on the strength of reflection of ultrasonic waves. In most cases, low reflectivity is described using cold colors (blues and greens), while high reflectivity is presented using hot colors (reds and yellows). High reflectivity will in most cases be an indication of presence of objects and discontinuities, like reinforcement, cracks, delaminations, and voids. Low reflectivity in most cases will represent a sound condition. Figure 8 shows a typical B-scan as viewed in the equipment display for several types of features and defects encountered during inspections. \nFigure 8. Composite Graph. Typical B-scans Showing Reinforcement, Backwall, Delamination, and Multiples.\nThe following are guidelines for interpreting data for common defects and features: \nBackwall (element thickness): Measuring the thickness of an element is based on the evaluation of the travel time of an ultrasonic wave reflected from the backwall. To get a clear reflection from the backwall, it is necessary to have a string contrast in acoustic impedances of the element material and material behind the backwall. Detecting the backwall of an element is illustrated in the left side of figure 8, identified by a high-amplitude reflection plotted in red. The horizontal shape of reflection is an indication of a constant thickness of the element.   \nReinforcement, conduit, tendons, etc.: Reinforcement, conduit, tendons, and other cable-like objects are identified as localized high-intensity reflections, as shown in figure 8. Similar to the backwall detection, there must be a contrast in acoustic impedances of concrete and the objects. The most effective way to detect the objects is by scanning perpendicular to the direction of their layout. A single scan will identify a linear object as a circular or oval high-amplitude (red) region. The position and orientation of a linear object is defined from numerous parallel scans across the object. It is generally not possible to identify the material type. Examining the phase of the reflection can provide some insight on whether the reflector is of acoustic impedance higher or lower than the surrounding concrete. Rebars are most commonly recognized by a regular spacing between the detected objects.  \nDelamination: Similar to the backwall, delamination is identified as a high-amplitude linear reflection shallower than the backwall. Therefore, it is necessary to establish the position of the backwall. Since delamination is often a curved and inclined surface, it may appear as a linear object of a variable depth, as illustrated in figure 8. Since a delamination prevents propagation of an ultrasonic wave below it, the backwall is usually not visible at delamination locations. Instead, ultrasonic waves get confined between the delamination and the top surface, which may result in multiple equally-spaced reflections with depth in the B-scan.  \nAir- and water-filled voids: Voids appear as high amplitude reflections of a finite size. Because both air- and water-filled voids are of a lower acoustic impedance than concrete, it is nearly impossible to determine whether the void is filled with water. \nA sample color-coded 3-D image of a surveyed element is presented in figure 9. The color scheme is scaled based on the intensity variations of the reflected shear waves received by the transducer array. With this intensity scaling, any discontinuities in hot color are readily apparent, with distinctively different wave speeds. \nFigure 9. Contour Map.

Examples of common defects are briefly as follows:\nFruiting bodies\n The presence of fruiting bodies, a positive indication of fungal attack, can indicate substantial decay in wood members. While some fungi species generate fruiting bodies after a minor decay, others may produce fruiting bodies after a substantial decay level. Fruiting bodies can be developed when the untreated wood grains are exposed to water [1].\nFigure 1. Fruiting body at the interface of beams [1].\nSurface depressions/ sunken surface or localized collapse\nThe presence of surface depressions can indicate the internal decay of wood members. Decay can generate voids or pockets near the surface of wood, leaving a thin intact/partially intact layer at the surface [1]. As a result of loss in strength and load-bearing capacity, the surface of decayed members may sink when subjected to external loading. Furthermore, the localized crush of a member can indicate a substantial decay [1].\nSource: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service.\nFigure 2. A scenario leading to the surface depressions of a wood member [1].\nStaining and discoloration\nStaining and discoloration of wood indicate water exposure, and potentially high-moisture areas favorable for decay. The rust stains from metal fasteners can also indicate high-moisture areas due to wetting [1].\nInsect activity\nThe presence of holes, wood powder (frass), and insects can indicate wood damage due to insect activity. Decay can make wood attractive to insects such as carpenter ants [1].\nSource: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service.\nFigure 3. Damage to a wood pile by carpenter ants [1]. The member was initially deteriorated by decay, which attracted carpenter ants.\nPlant and moss growth\nPlant/Moss growth in the checks and splits of wood members can indicate high moisture levels for a sustained period. Such conditions support fungal decay [1].\nMissing members\nMissing members refer to the conditions where part or entire structural members are removed [1].\nSplits and checks\nSplits and checks can indicate a weakened member. While the depth of checks varies, splits extend through a member cross-section. These defects of sufficient depth can lead to the deterioration of the inner untreated section of a member through absorbing moisture and subsequent fungal decay.\nSource: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service.\nFigure 4. Photo. Large timber member treated with preservatives, which have only penetrated a certain depth of the member (darker color).(1)\nAlterations\nAlterations/modifications of structural members can weaken wood members.1\nDescription\nVisual inspection is the simplest and most commonly used method for evaluating the wood condition. It requires a sufficient light source and is useful for detecting intermediate or advanced surface decay, water damage, mechanical damage, or failed members. During visual inspection, an inspector looks for evidence of decay or damage to wood members, noting areas that require further investigation.\nPhysical Principle\nFor visual inspection, sufficient light needs to be reflected from the objects to an inspector\u2019s eyes.\nData Acquisition\nAs a part of visual inspection, an inspector may perform routine and in-depth inspections. The routine inspection involves reviewing previous reports and visually inspecting members from beneath a bridge, locating obvious decay and damage. On the other hand, indepth inspections require a closer look at one or several members to identify defects that cannot be easily detected during a routine inspection. During the indepth inspection, a hands-on inspection may be performed. Bridge members may be inspected from distances less than an arm\u2019s length away. Visual inspection may be accompanied by other nondestructive evaluation technologies to quantify the extent of the defects.2>\nData Processing\nNo data processing is required\nData Interpretation\nTo identify the potential source of decay, an inspector compares the defects in the field with known types of defects (e.g., target of investigation section).\nAdvantages\nAdvantages of visual inspection include the following:\nRapid and well-established field inspection technique\nSimple\nLow cost\nLimitations\nSome of the limitations of visual inspection include the following:\nSufficient light and experience is required.\nIdentification of decay is difficult at early stages when remedial treatments can be effective to prolong the service life of a member.(1)\nQuantitative information about the mechanical and physical properties of members is not provided.\nReferences\n1.
